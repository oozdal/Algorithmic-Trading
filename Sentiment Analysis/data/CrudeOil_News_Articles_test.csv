Russia OPEC To Gradually Ease Production Cuts In May July.html,"The OPEC+ alliance will gradually ease the collective production cuts between May and July, as the ministers agreed earlier this month, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told reporters on Friday. The decision was taken by OPEC+, and the gradual reversal of part of the cuts will take place between May and July, Novak said, as carried by the Russian news agency Interfax. Russia, the key partner of OPEC in the OPEC+ group, decided together with its allies led by Saudi Arabia to ease the collective production cuts by over 1 million barrels per day (bpd) over the next three months to July.
 In early April, OPEC+ decided to gradually increase collective oil production by 350,000 bpd in each of May and June and by more than 400,000 bpd in July. Additionally, Saudi Arabia will also gradually ease its extra unilateral cut of 1 million bpd over the course of the next few months, beginning with monthly production increases of 250,000 bpd in each of May and June. Before the OPEC+ meeting that agreed on these parameters, Novak said that the situation on the global oil market had improved since the March meeting. There are still many uncertainties on the global oil market, especially in Europe, Russia’s top oil diplomat said, but noted that there is currently a deficit of 2 million bpd on the market. Novak also said at that meeting that he expects global oil demand to increase by 5 million bpd-5.5 million bpd this year compared to last year.
 This week, OPEC raised its global demand growth estimate, and so did the International Energy Agency (IEA), giving the market hope that demand would rebound strongly later this year and offset the weakness seen in the first half due to surging cases and lockdowns in Europe and major oil importer India. The IEA now sees oil demand rising by 5.7 million bpd in 2021 compared to 2020, revising up its estimate by 230,000 bpd “to take account of better economic forecasts and robust prompt indicators.”"
Oil Demand Could Peak By 2026 Goldman Sachs.html,"Despite a bullish stance on the short-term future of oil demand, Goldman Sachs has a grimmer prediction for the longer-term future of the commodity: in a Bloomberg report, the investment banking major was quoted as expecting “anemic” demand for oil from the transport sector after 2025. “Government policies driving higher efficiency gains and lower emissions have had the strongest bearing on road transport demand,” Goldman analysts said in the report. “Petrochemicals will become the new baseload for oil demand, driven by economic growth and rising consumption, especially in emerging markets.”
 The transport sector is the largest consumer of crude oil, but the wider adoption of electric cars will undermine demand, according to Goldman Sachs, and it could peak by 2026. As for a return of demand to pre-pandemic levels, this will not happen at all, according to the investment bank. In addition to rising electric vehicle sales, driven by tighter emissions regulation in Europe and the U.S., a permanent shift towards working from home for many in employment would also have a negative effect on oil demand, as 43 percent of oil consumption comes from passenger vehicles, the Bloomberg report noted.
 Over the short term, however, Goldman is pretty bullish on oil. The bank said earlier this month it expected a strong rebound in oil demand over the summer, noting this would require OPEC to relax its production controls further and bring back another 2 million bpd in the third quarter. Seeing as Iran plans to boost its own production by that many barrels daily, however, the cartel may need to keep the caps, all else being equal. As for prices, Goldman expects Brent to reach $75 per barrel in the third quarter thanks to the returning demand and to the brightening global economic outlook driven by government stimulus, notably in the United States."
3 Oil Stocks To Watch This Spring.html,"Oil bulls who have been praying for oil prices to cross the $70 per barrel mark to affirm a full recovery after a very encouraging 6 month-long rally have unfortunately been disappointed. Oil prices seem to have hit a ceiling at the high 60s and are currently flirting with the low 60s with a Covid-19 resurgence raining on the bulls' parade thanks to new lockdowns in key consumer regions such as India and the UK. Still, the U.S. oil and gas sector remains in good stead; J.P. Morgan has estimated that Permian's Delaware Basin oil drillers now require oil prices of just ~$33/bbl to break even down from $40/bbl in 2019. Indeed, JPM says most U.S. onshore operators are economic at current oil prices, and many operators are even likely to ramp up activity in H2 and build solid momentum for higher volumes in 2022. U.S. shale producers are likely to increase production in the coming months but will still maintain production discipline and come nowhere near pre-pandemic production levels. In fact, they could fall short by 7% in the Permian--the largest shale region--and a whopping 26% in the Eagle Ford--the second-largest shale play. Indeed, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) CEO Vicki Hollub recently conceded that returning to production levels of ~13M bbl/day achieved in Q1 2020 requires ""too much investment,"" something the sector can ill-afford under the current circumstances. And now, OPEC is predicting much stronger oil demand for 2021 ... Bearing that in mind, here are three oil-related investments that could weather temporary storms better than most ... #1 Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP) President Biden's administration is reportedly planning the first major tax increase in nearly three decades in the next economic stimulus package. The president is reportedly planning to include the first major tax hike since 1993 in the next spending bill following the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that Congress has already approved.
 In the oil and gas sector, the biggest winner yet in a Biden tax hike though would be Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs), well represented by the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP), a $4-billion passive fund holding stakes in 19 MLPs. MLPs are business ventures that operate as publicly traded companies, with the company that manages day-to-day operations being the general partner while the investor acts as a limited partner. The first MLP was formed by shale company Apache Corp. (NYSE:APA) in 1981. In recent years, MLPs have fallen out of favor after changes were made to the way partnerships are taxed and, perhaps more importantly, due to Trump's tax bonanza. In 2018, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reversed a key policy in MLP tax costs for interstate pipelines that led to increased cost of business for some companies.   Related: The World Still Needs Hundreds Of Billions Of Barrels Of Oil A tax hike could reverse some of the damage and significantly improve the value proposition of MLPs. According to CreditSights analyst Charles Johnston, Biden's tax plan would increase the tax advantage for MLPs over C-corps from around seven percentage points to 17. The Alerian MLP ETF offers a yield of around 7% but still appears cheap. #2 Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE:MMP) Yet another MLP, Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P.  (NYSE:MMP) is a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based company that engages in the transportation, storage, and distribution of refined petroleum products.
 There are several reasons why this might be a prime holding. MMP sports a current dividend yield of 9.13%, easily one of the highest in the sector, making it attractive for income investors. The company has ranked at, or near, the top of MLP yields and returns for about two decades, thanks to what Morningstar has attributed to MMP's management quality and capital allocation record. Further, MMP boasts a BBB+ credit rating or its equivalent from both S&P and Moody's(stable), good for a low default risk of 5%, one of the best in the industry.  Related: Oxford Institute: Don't Expect A Supercycle In Oil MMP is currently trading at under 9x cash flow, with 0.2% CAGR long-term growth chalked in. This essentially means that the stock is unlikely to become a gusher--but also offers pretty decent downside protection. #3 Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is an independent E&P company in the United States that engages in the exploration, production, and refining of crude oil and condensate, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. MRO owns the famous Sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through Karnes and Atascosa Counties. MRO stock has enjoyed a massive 161% rally over the past 12 months and 61% in the year-to-date thanks to massive improvements in crack spreads. Crack spreads have nearly doubled from $12 per barrel six months ago to $23 currently. Crack spreads refer to the overall price differential between the price of a barrel of crude oil and the price of petroleum products refined from it.  The ""crack"" is an industry term that refers to the process of breaking apart crude oil into different components, including gaseous products like propane, heating fuel, gasoline, light distillates like jet fuel, heavy distillates like grease and intermediate distillates like diesel fuel. MRO has been able to benefit from the rebound thanks to the company's efficient operations, low breakeven prices, and healthy free cash flow. This is a stock that could still see impressive upside should oil prices continue to rally to $70-$75."
Shell To Exhaust Dwindling Oil Gas Reserves By 2040.html,"Shell expects to have produced 75 percent of its current proved oil and gas reserves by 2030, and only around 3 percent after 2040, the supermajor said in its Energy Transition Strategy that it will put to a non-binding shareholder vote next month.    Discussing the risk of stranded assets in the energy transition, Shell said that every year it tests its oil and gas portfolio under different scenarios, including prolonged low oil prices, and cross-references assets with break-even prices to assess if they would still be viable in case of low oil and gas prices. At December 31, 2020, Shell estimated that around 70 percent of its proved plus probable oil and gas reserves, known as 2P, will be produced by 2030, and only 5 percent after 2040.   
 Shell’s proved oil and gas reserves have been declining in recent years, shrinking the reserves life to below eight years of production. In 2020, Shell’s proved reserves—taking production into account—decreased by 1.972 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) to 9.124 billion boe at December 31, 2020, the firm’s annual report showed.   That’s reserves for just seven years of production, lower than most peers.
 The declining reserves life is not unique for Shell. The largest international oil companies have seen their average crude reserves drop by 25 percent over the past five years, which could be a challenge for Big Oil’s production and earnings in the coming years, Citi said earlier this month. The supermajors reported lower reserves in their most recent reports, also due to the 2020 oil price and oil demand collapse, which forced all of them to write off billions of U.S. dollars off the value of assets.   In Shell’s case, the declining reserves life is not in contradiction to its assessment from earlier this year that its oil production peaked in 2019 and is set for a continual decline over the next three decades.  "
The Permian Faces An Empty Pipeline Crisis.html,"Just a few short years ago, the United States was producing more shale oil than ever, pumping as much and as quickly as they could to keep up with an industry and a market going gangbusters. At its height, U.S. crude production reached an apex of 13 million barrels per day (bpd). Even as oil price volatility and the short lifespan of shale wells caused plenty of small-scale booms and busts in the West Texas Permian Basin, the sector charged onwards with a steadfast growth mindset. More and more companies popped up to get in while the getting was good and pipeline companies laid down as much infrastructure as they could to keep up with shale’s rapid expansion. And then the COVID-19 pandemic arrived. In early 2020 the novel coronavirus took a massive bite out of global oil demand, and instead of banding together to keep the oil industry afloat, the leading OPEC+ members, Saudi Arabia and Russia, got into a spat that turned into an all-out oil price war, tanking global oil markets, flooding oil storage around the world, and ultimately pushing the West Texas Intermediate crude benchmark far past rock bottom and down to nearly $40 below zero per barrel on April 20, 2020. Some are now referring to that jaw-dropping crash as “Black April.” And indeed, it’s been a long, slow road to recovery since then - and the fact is, while oil prices have largely rebounded, it’s more than possible that the U.S. shale industry will never break its production records. Of course, U.S. shale isn’t dead, but it is far from a sure thing that the sector will ever be able to return to its full pre-pandemic glory. No one knows for certain whether we’re already experiencing peak oil, but there are plenty of experts that say if we haven’t already peaked, we can expect to in the very near future. At present, United States crude output is hovering around 11 million bpd. Some analysts are expecting more of a recovery in 2022, but very little growth is projected for the duration of this year. In fact, nearly half of all oil pipelines leading out of the Permian Basin are projected to run completely dry by the end of 2021, according to reporting by Reuters. 
  Related: Oxford Institute: Don't Expect A Supercycle In Oil “By the fourth quarter, total utilization of the largest oil pipelines from the Permian is expected to drop to 57%,” the report summarized findings from global energy research and consultancy group Wood Mackenzie. To put in perspective just how unprecedented of a downturn this is, at the worst point of the last market bust in 2016, pipelines were still running at 70 percent. So much oil pipeline capacity is now unused and unneeded, with no clear turnaround in sight, that major oil pipeline companies are casting about for other products to fill the lines and mulling over the possibility of selling stakes in operations in order to generate cash flow. 
 And the pipeline gap is only getting worse. More pipelines were already set to come online in this time frame, “growing the gap between production and capacity covered by long-term contracts to a record over 1 million bpd in February.” These developments have taken a massive toll on the bottom line for pipeline companies. “A lot of [pipeline] companies had to cut their dividends,"" said Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at TortoiseEcofin told Reuters. ""It has created some skepticism on the investor base about the sustainability of the sector."" If any sector is well-versed in the art of the boom-and-bust economy, it’s shale. If oil prices continue to rally and demand continues its steady climb back toward pre-pandemic levels, shale has proven time and again that it is more than capable of rising from the ashes. Some have even speculated that a shale exploration surge is on the horizon."
OPECs Bullish Demand Data Sparks Hope Of New Oil Rally.html,"OPEC has revised its 2021 oil demand upward to stand 190,000 bpd higher than last month's estimates, on the back of an economic rebound that surpasses last month's outlook. Global 2021 oil demand is now expected to average 96.46 million bpd for the full year, according to OPEC's latest projects included in its April Monthly Oil Market Report. That figure is up from 96.27 million bpd in last month's report, and up from the newly estimated 2020 oil demand figure of 90.51 million bpd. In last month's report, OPEC had estimated 2020 global oil demand at 90.39 million bpd. Behind the Curtain This upward revision comes after the group's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, told the group at the last OPEC meeting that the oil demand figures they were using were too low and that actual global oil demand would be higher. As the only true swing producer in the group, Saudi Arabia still has enormous sway within OPEC. The group ultimately decided to gradually lift oil production starting in May 2021 based on these figures, which it did not disclose at the time. Whatever spark, an optimistic oil demand projection by OPEC is bound to have a positive effect on prices.
 For its April MOMR, OPEC cited a ""stronger economic rebound than assumed last month."" Supporting this economic rebound, OPEC said, were stimulus programs, easing of Covid-19 lockdown measures, and accelerated vaccine rollout, particularly in the OECD region. Related Video: Iran’s Oil Exports Render Sanctions Irrelevant On the vaccine front, which OPEC cites as cause for oil demand optimism, an estimated 20% of the U.S. population has been fully vaccinated. In Israel, a whopping 57% of the population has been fully vaccinated. But overall, less than 10% of the world has received a single dose. Some countries are not expected to reach the 20% threshold by the end of 2021. The Sad Truth About H12021 While OPEC has adjusted up its oil demand projections for the whole year—and adjusted its production to match—it revised downward its oil demand projections for the first half of this year. Its reasons for lowering its H12021 projections seem to mimic the reasons it raised its full-year oil demand projections: Covid-19 measures in OECD Europe, and sluggish—actual—Q1 2021 demand data in the non-OECD region. And OPEC raised another caution flag in its report: ""Risk will remain high during 2021, subject to COVID-19 developments, and the pace of reaching heard immunity targets."" OPEC also pointed out additional risks that included new energy policies and the ""effectiveness of the large scale monetary and fiscal stimulus measures""—all of which will impact oil demand in the short-term. OPEC production
 While the data for the first part of 2021 showed worse oil demand than previously expected, OPEC's actual Q1 production for 2021 increased. OPEC's first-quarter production this year was 25.138 million bpd, compared to the previous quarter's 24.941 based on OPEC's secondary source figures.  Related: Oxford Institute: Don't Expect A Supercycle In Oil The countries showing increases in production of more than 100,000 bpd quarter on quarter are all the countries that are currently exempt from OPEC's production cut agreement. Iran, Libya, and Venezuela produced a combined average of 558,000 barrels per day more in Q1 2021 than they did in the last quarter of 2020.  The UAE also increased production by 96,000 bpd quarter over quarter. Iraq represented the fifth-largest increase at 64,000 bpd, while it was supposed to be producing under its quota to make up for previous overages as spelled out in the production cut agreement. Thankfully for OPEC, swing producer Saudi Arabia produced an average of 522,000 barrels per day less in Q1 2021 compared to Q4 2020. For the month of March, Iran, Angola, Iraq, and Libya saw the largest increase in crude production, while Saudi Arabia was, again, saw the largest decrease, bringing its March production to 8.090 million bpd. Overall, OPEC’s March production was 201,000 bpd higher than February, at 25.042 million bpd. This compares to an average 25.645 million bpd across all of 2020. OPEC’s production is expected to increase in the coming months after the last OPEC+ meeting agreed to ease up on the production cut quotas. In the first tranche of increases, an additional 500,000 bpd is expected—half from OPEC+ and half from Saudi Arabia’s voluntary cuts. Saudi Arabia, however, has signaled to the market that the group will be flexible with its production quotas to meet demand, wherever it may be."
Chinas Oil Imports Surge Ahead Of Refinery Maintenance Season.html,"China imported 11.69 million barrels of crude oil daily last month, up by 21 percent on the year, Reuters has reported, citing official customs data. Earlier this month, energy analytics services provider OilX calculated China’s March oil imports at 11.26 million bpd, noting, however, that these calculations did not include Iranian oil, which China has been buying in ever greater amounts.
 Despite being 21 percent higher on the year, the March average was lower than the average for February, which came in at 11.73 million barrels daily, Reuters noted. Analysts now expect a further slowdown in oil imports as refiners start seasonal maintenance. It’s also worth mentioning that March 2020 was a month of lockdowns in China, which severely affected the country’s oil consumption along with all other commodities. In addition to the seasonal factor, higher oil prices will also likely discourage a rebound in oil buying by Chinese refiners and traders, according to one analyst from energy consultancy FGE.
 There is also another factor that could see lower imports from “official” sources: China recently struck a massive investment deal with Iran and has been buying millions of barrels of Iranian crude on the quiet. Analysts believe that Iran has offered China significant discounts on its crude to stimulate more purchases, despite U.S. sanctions and warnings from Washington to stop buying Iranian crude. Discounts will be important as oil prices tick higher, hovering around $60 a barrel. On the other hand, a decline in Chinese imports for whatever reason would likely pressure prices, especially because it would coincide with OPEC+’s production increases that aim to return some 2 million bpd to global markets by July. This would be a welcome development for Chinese independent refiners, who are currently enjoying rising refining margins thanks to a pickup in construction activity across China after the end of winter."
Saudi Arabias Breakeven Oil Price To Drop To 65 Next Year.html,"Higher oil prices and an expected rebound in the global economy and oil demand are set to lower the fiscal breakeven oil price of the major Middle Eastern oil producers this year and next, with the breakeven oil price for Saudi Arabia dropping to $65.70 in 2022 from $77.90 in 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said. In its regional economic outlook published on Sunday, the IMF forecasts that all oil exporters from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)—except for Iran—will see their fiscal breakeven oil price, the oil price at which the fiscal balance is zero, lower in 2022 compared to previous years. The expectations are based on assumptions that the authorities will keep the current policies in place and that the simple average of the Brent, Dubai Fateh, and WTI crude oil prices would be $52.64 a barrel in 2021 and $50.07 a barrel in 2022.
 In the case of Saudi Arabia, the fiscal breakeven oil price is set to drop to as low as $65.70 next year, compared to $76.20 this year, and a high as $81.90 in the last pre-pandemic year 2019, according to the IMF. Saudi Arabia, however, is not the producer with the lowest breakeven prices. To compare, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is set to see its fiscal breakeven oil price at $60.40 next year, down from $68.20 in 2020 and $64.60 this year.  Related: Morgan Stanley: Oil Prices Stuck In $60 Range This Summer Qatar’s breakeven oil price is expected to drop to as low as $40.40 in 2022, from $46.20 in 2020 and $43.10 in 2021. Qatar has the lowest fiscal breakeven oil price among all MENA oil-exporting countries.
 While lower fiscal breakeven price is good news for all oil-dependent economies to balance their budgets, climate change and the energy transition are creating new challenges for the Middle Eastern petrostates, the IMF said. “The region’s oil exporters face the additional challenge of making the transition away from oil dependence as the world progressively shifts away from fossil fuels. Rebuilding financial buffers and pursuing economic and fiscal diversification while ameliorating any negative distributional impact on households, are key policy priorities in this regard,” the IMF noted.  "
The 7 Trillion Reason Saudi Arabia Is Cutting Oil Production.html,"Strict production discipline by OPEC and its partners is the #1 reason why oil prices have managed to stage a remarkable recovery and stay relatively high after plunging to historical lows in 2020. Early this month, oil prices reacted positively after OPEC and its non-OPEC partners, aka OPEC+, reached a favorable agreement to start gradually curbing production cuts beginning in May. Starting next month, OPEC+ will allow an additional 350,000 barrels per day to join the markets, with another 350,000 coming in June and June and 450,000 barrels per day slated for July. Currently, OPEC is holding back just over 7 million barrels per day, with Saudi Arabia voluntarily cutting an additional 1 million barrels per day. Indeed, the OPEC kingpin has since taken on voluntary cuts of 1 million barrels per day from the beginning of February. That marks a sharp turnaround from the Kingdom’s stance just a year ago when Riyadh and Moscow failed to agree to deep supply cutbacks in a bid to cope with falling oil demand leading to a supply glut and oil prices descending into negative territory for the first time in history. And it certainly appears like overkill bearing in mind that Saudi Arabia has some of the lowest production costs anywhere in the world. However, Saudi Arabia could be eyeing an even bigger prize with its generous cuts.  Related: Italian Oil Heiress Arrested In Major Mafia Bust Diversifying the economy Whereas Saudi Arabia, the region’s largest economy of the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) boasts the largest economy and the lowest production costs of any Arab nation, the harsh reality is that the country needs significantly higher oil prices than the current WTI price of $59.50 per barrel to balance its books. Indeed, Saudi Arabia’s fiscal breakeven price of $76.10 per barrel means that it remains heavily in the red, with only Qatar being able to record a surplus thanks to its low breakeven point of $39.90 per barrel. Budget deficit
  Source: Reuters Saudi Arabia desperately needs higher oil prices not only to balance its books but also to lower its dependence on crude. That goal is even more critical now that Saudi Arabia is pushing a 7.2 trillion-dollar plan to diversify its economy, essentially requiring state companies to cut dividends they pay the government in order to boost spending. For a company like Saudi Aramco--whose $75 billion dividends last year were the highest for state revenues--any reduction in dividends would need to be compensated by higher oil prices to boost transfers to the sovereign through taxes and royalties instead. Saudi Arabia has a target to boost domestic spending to 27 trillion riyals ($7.2 trillion) by 2030 as the world’s biggest oil exporter seeks to tame a huge deficit caused by lower oil revenues and weak demand due to the pandemic. Related Video: Iran’s Oil Exports Render Sanctions Irrelevant To achieve its goal, Saudi Arabia needs to curb supply over the coming years in a bid to boost oil prices. The fiscal benefits of higher oil prices can easily outweigh the impact of lower oil production on the economy. Whereas Saudi companies participating in the new programme have the liberty to decide how to fund their investments, the most likely avenues are dividends, soft loans, debt, and other financial instruments.
 Further, Saudi Arabia desperately needs to boost investments coming into the country (FDI) by nearly 100x, from $5.5 billion last year to FDI flows of over $500 billion over the next decade. Betting on clean energy On the energy front, Saudi Arabia is clearly committed to moving from crude to cleaner energy sources. The Saudi government has announced plans to build a $5 billion green hydrogen plant that will power the planned megacity of Neom when it opens in 2025. Dubbed Helios Green Fuels, the hydrogen plant will use solar and wind energy to generate 4GW of clean energy that will be used to produce hydrogen. But here’s the main kicker: Helios could soon produce hydrogen that’s cheaper than oil. Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) estimates that Helios’ costs could reach $1.50 per kilogram by 2030, way cheaper than the average cost of green hydrogen at $5 per kilogram and even cheaper than gray hydrogen made from cracking natural gas. Saudi Arabia enjoys a serious competitive advantage in the green hydrogen business thanks to its perpetual sunshine, wind, and vast tracts of unused land. In fact, Saudi Aramco has told investors that it has abandoned immediate plans to develop its LNG sector in favor of hydrogen. Aramco has said that the Kingdom’s immediate plan is to produce enough natural gas for domestic use to stop burning oil in its power plants and convert the remainder into hydrogen. Blue hydrogen is made from natural gas either by Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) or AutoThermal Reforming (ATR), with the CO2 generated captured and then stored. As the greenhouse gasses are captured, this mitigates the environmental impacts on the planet. Saudi Arabia clearly has its eyes on a future whereby the economy will stop relying too heavily on oil. Whether or not it will remain committed enough to achieve its long-term goal is another question."
Enis Latest Oil Discovery Could Be Big For Angola.html,"Italian firm Eni has made a new light oil discovery off the coast of Angola after exploration activities recommenced following a year of pandemic restrictions.  The discovery, made on Tuesday, is in Angola’s deepwater Block 15/06. Eni believes the exploration well, drilled at 500 metres in the Cuica exploration prospect, could hold as much as 200 to 250 million barrels of oil and presents the second big oil discovery in the area.   ""The well-head location, intentionally placed close to East Hub’s subsea network, will allow a fast-track tie-in of the exploration well and relevant production, thus immediately creating value while extending the Armada Olombendo FPSO production plateau. It is expected that production will start within six months after discovery,"" Eni stated.  Eni, which has been an active part of the country’s oil industry since 1980, produces around 120,000 bpd of oil in Angola. The firm has announced an anticipated $7 billion investment in Angola by 2025 in the areas of research, production, refining and solar energy, with the objective of cutting carbon emissions, job creation and diversifying the economy. As well as being an OPEC member, Angola is the second largest oil producing country in sub-Saharan Africa, producing an estimated 1.37 million bpd of oil and around 17,904 million cubic feet of natural gas. However, production in the country has been far below its full potential due to low investment in recent years owing to the drop in oil prices. 
 In January, Angola received IMF approval for a disbursement of over $480 million under a $3.7 billion loan agreement due to the ongoing struggle with low oil prices as well as weak exports.  To attract greater investment, the Angolan government has launched a new strategy with the aim of increasing production, hoping to tap into 57 billion barrels in undiscovered oil reserves. The government has also amended its legal and fiscal terms to make it easier for foreign companies to invest in the oil and gas sector, attracting firms with the country’s competitive production costs.  Greater investment is expected for 2021, for a country with a substantial oil potential, with 9 billion barrels of proven oil resources. There are also significant opportunities for refined petroleum products as Angola imports 80 percent of its needs in this area at present.  Related: Oil Demand Boosted By Highest Number Of Flights Since COVID Started Last month, Angola's National Agency for Oil, Gas and Biofuels (ANPG) released its timeline for the evaluation of its 2020 oil and gas licensing round. ANGP is hoping to expand oil research and evaluation programmes in sedimentary basins, better understand the country’s hydrocarbon potential and attract new investors in line with its Hydrocarbon Exploration Strategy 2020-2025.
 In early April, Angola announced that is has begun initiatives to develop its marginal fields, creating opportunities in nine blocks with an expected investment of $67.4 billion over the next five years.  The country is also expected to see a return on its renewable energy investment, with solar power production expected from 2022. Major energy firms Eni and Total both have a stake in the country’s solar energy sector in the provinces of Namibe and Huíla respectively. Angola has a significant untapped oil potential which has experienced underinvestment due to the volatility of oil prices over the last five years. However, the government is going full throttle on its oil and gas investment plan for 2021. This paired with new discoveries by oil major Eni, as well as advances in renewables, makes Angola the African oil giant to watch over the next five years. "
Iran Could Soon Officially Return 2 Million Bpd Of Oil To Global Markets.html,"Iranian crude could return to global markets sooner rather than later as this week’s start of negotiations between Tehran and the five world powers that, together with the U.S. signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that put an end to Iran’s nuclear ambitions in 2015. The Oil and Gas Journal reports, citing oil analytics firm Kpler, that the start of negotiations is a positive sign for things to come: soon, Tehran and Washington could too sit at the negotiating table. If this happens and they reach an agreement on Iran’s nuclear plans, some 2 million bpd of Iranian crude could be added to OPEC’s total. The talks were held in Vienna earlier this week, and Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani said, as quoted by CNBC, they were a success and that they opened a new chapter in efforts to save the so-called Iran nuclear deal.
 Both Tehran and the new administration in Washington have signaled they are ready to start negotiating the lifting of U.S. sanctions and Iran’s oil industry’s return to normal operation. However, both sides insist that the other one makes the first move: Iran wants the U.S. to first lift sanctions before it stops enriching uranium, and the U.S. wants Iran to first stop enriching uranium before it lifts the sanctions. Related Video: Iran’s Oil Exports Render Sanctions Irrelevant Yet not everything has been smooth. An attempt by Washington to offer a sort of an olive branch to Tehran failed earlier this year. The attempt consisted of the U.S. side offering Tehran to unfreeze $1 billion in oil revenues blocked under the sanction regime, but Tehran called the proposal ridiculous.
 It is important for both sides to settle their differences sooner rather than later. Iran is preparing for elections, and if the current government is replaced with a more conservative one, negotiations will become a lot harder. If they succeed, however, OPEC will have a problem on its hands, although it may not be as big as some would expect. Iran is already exporting more oil than official numbers would suggest, mostly to China.  This oil will simply come to light once the sanctions are lifted. Perhaps a bigger problem, for U.S. oil producers at least, is that Iranian oil will start flowing to India as well, and may displace some U.S. volumes that India has been taking in after it stopped its purchases from Iran because of the U.S. sanctions."
Many Drilled US Wells Will Never Be Completed.html,"Fracking crews are increasing their activity in U.S. shale basins, finishing off a slew of DUC wells, according to the EIA’s latest Monthly Drilling Report. As oil and gas companies focus on finishing off wells they’ve already drilled, on the sidelines, observers are wondering whether this is a fluke or whether the industry has really learned its lesson about drilling rigs that they do not intend to complete.  Are we seeing typical industry behavior, which may indicate that we are in for another DUC increase now that drilling activity has picked up? Tackling the Fracklog The way to describe the DUC count is a “fracklog” because it measures the number of wells that have been drilled but not yet completed—essentially creating a backlog of half-finished wells that are not producing oil or gas. The higher the DUC count, the more money oil companies have spent drilling wells that are not yet working—ostensibly while drilling more wells, which they also may not complete. For the U.S. shale industry, the DUC count has been a bellwether for the oil industry; the higher the DUC count, the more money oil and gas companies are sinking into wells that are stuck in limbo and not producing. This could either mean fiscal irresponsibility or a rapidly changing shift in the markets that too quickly rendered wells once deemed wise as obsolete. Of course, there are always DUCs. The logistics behind scheduling drilling and completion crews necessitate a certain number of drilled wells be made available to later complete. Companies often like to keep several months of drilled wells in inventory. And most wells that are drilled are finished within a year. Related Video: The Conditions Are Ripe for A Second Shale Boom 
 But an excessive number of DUCs could signify that something is amiss in the industry. The Whole Story The true fracklog didn’t boom during the pandemic. The DUC counts started climbing ever higher sometime in 2017—around the time the U.S. shale industry was catching flack for out of control debt loads.   True, during the pandemic, there were certainly a high number of DUCs. But the EIA reported DUC count of 7,685 in July 2020—after oil demand crashed, rendering foolish the process of spending more money to complete a well that a company didn’t need for production—is just par for the course, according to earlier EIA data. According to the EIA, the DUC count has been over 7,500, for the most part anyway, since mid-2018. The Dead DUC is Still a DUC But there are some, like Raymond James analyst John Freeman, who claimed this year in a note to clients that the United States’ true DUC count is much lower, given that many of the wells included in the EIA’s DUC count are dead in the water and many years old, likely never to be completed. According to Freeman, this figure is as much as 22% too high. A 2019 Federal Reserve of Dallas survey of oil and gas company executives suggests that half of the respondents agree that the EIA is overestimating the number of DUCs.  Related: Investors Rush To Oil Stocks Despite ESG Push In a low oil price environment, oil and gas companies may spend money on finishing off an already drilled well, rather than on drilling a new well. But companies will continue to strive to keep that DUC inventory in their back pocket should the market call for it. But when oil prices have been low for a long time—and demand for crude or gas remains low, those low oil prices may never justify completing a well, resulting in another dead DUC.
 Still, those DUCs are counted. Where We Are Now In 2014, the number of wells being drilled exceeded the DUC count. When drilling slowed at the end of that year, the number of DUCs continued to rise. There was a period leading up to 2017 that saw a dip in the DUC count. But before too long, DUCs were again on the rise.  The latest data suggests that the number of DUCs began to fall in July 2020 as oil inventories boomed, oil prices were ultra-low, and drilling and fracking activity had slowed to levels not seen in years. The DUC count has continued to fall since then, while drilling and completion activities have started to pick up. The gap between drilling and completion activity has closed over the last few years, while the gap between drilling activity and DUCs has inverted.   But there is an unmistakable correlation between drilling activity and DUCs, with an anywhere from 20 to 50-week lag from rig count shifts to corresponding DUC shifts. If that pattern holds true, we may be in for another increase in the number of DUCs in the next few months. Unless, that is, the EIA revaluates the method it uses for establishing its DUC counts. Or, as some suggest, shale has learned to belt tighten, and spending is shifted more heavily toward completing rather than drilling."
UAEs Oil Giant Looks To List Drilling Business In Local IPO.html,"Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is talking to banks about the potential listing of its oil drilling unit on the local stock exchange, Reuters reported on Thursday, quoting three sources with knowledge of the plan. ADNOC Drilling is the largest drilling company in the Middle East, it says, and operates 63 onshore rigs, 20 offshore jackup rigs, and 11 island rigs. ADNOC Drilling provides drilling rigs and associated services to companies part of the ADNOC Group, and helps the oil firm of OPEC member the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to reach its production targets, the drilling firm says.   According to two of Reuters’ sources, ADNOC would like to have the initial public offering (IPO) take place this year. The size of the offering could be larger than US$1 billion, one source told Reuters, but added that the talks with the banks were at their early stages.
 In recent years, ADNOC has moved to monetize some of its assets and resources by listing its distribution business, selling a minority stake in its pipelines business, and entering in joint ventures in the upstream and downstream. In December 2017, ADNOC listed its fuel retail unit ADNOC Distribution on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, setting an IPO offer price that valued the unit at US$8.5 billion. Last year, after oil prices crashed and OPEC+, including the UAE, had to curtail massive production volumes to rebalance the market and prop up oil prices, ADNOC announced a US$20.7-billion deal with six international companies for the acquisition of a minority stake in ADNOC Gas Pipeline Assets.
 Under the terms of the deal, Global Infrastructure Partners, Brookfield Asset Management, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, Snam, and NH Investment and Securities will acquire a 49-percent interest in ADNOC Gas Pipeline Assets, a new subsidiary of the UAE’s national oil and gas company."
Southeast Asia Looks To Increase Offshore Oil Production.html,"Malaysia and Brunei have signed an agreement to develop two offshore oil fields on the maritime boundary, with greater exploration of recent ultra-deepwater discoveries. The governments from both countries signed a unitisation agreement to develop the Gumusut-Kakap and Geronggong-Jagus East offshore oil fields. Development will be managed by Malaysian state-owned Petronas and Brunei’s National Unitisation Secretariat (NUS).  The agreement took place during Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin's visit to Brunei. It is one of several initiatives that was agreed upon during the official visit.   “Having now formalised this landmark agreement, PETRONAS believes that both parties can look forward to continuing the strong momentum towards developing our nations’ energy sectors for the long-term growth and prosperity of both Brunei and Malaysia.” Tengku Muhammad Taufik Tengku Kamadjaja Aziz, Petronas president and group CEO, said of the agreement. The Gumusut-Kakap field waters reach a depth of 1,200m, allowing for the development of two ultra-deepwater projects, Gumusut and Kakap. The field consists of 19 undersea wells. The maritime border location provides a new area of development for the oil industry in both countries. 
 Malaysia and Brunei are also expected to sign a memorandum of understanding on Transport Cooperation to develop their partnership in the areas of safety, security, intelligent transport systems and logistics. In addition, the two states could soon also reach a modernised Air Services Agreement and are expected develop their partnership to enhance gas resources across the two countries.  In the 23rd Annual Leaders' Consultation, held in Brunei, the national leaders from both states solidified existing commitments to information and communication technology, agriculture - food supply chains and distribution, trade and tourism.  Related Video: Iran’s Oil Exports Render Sanctions Irrelevant This is not the only oil project to come out of Brunei in recent weeks. In late March, the government of Brunei announced plans to triple oil production over the next five years as Brunei Shell Petroleum (BSP) began exploratory drilling in deepwater wells. BSP is preparing to drill deepwater exploration wells Merbah Deep-1 and Jagus Subthrust-1. The company has had a significant stake in Brunei oil since the discovery of the Seria field in 1929, with around 4,000 employees and over 20,000 contractors at present.
 Brunei’s Ministry of Energy said of the development last week, “Both exploration wells will form a key test in proving new hydrocarbon volumes and opening up the deepwater, further in alignment to the ministry’s strong emphasis to the operators to develop existing deepwater fields in the near to mid term”.  The government hopes to expand national production to 350,000 bpd equivalent by 2025, owing largely to deepwater digging. This is a significant increase from the 2020 dip to 105,100 bpd.  As well as being hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, with four consecutive quarters of negative growth in 2020, Brunei’s oil industry has been declining since 2006. However, greater investment from BSP and the new exploration agreement with Malaysia could see the oil and gas industry develop substantially over the next decade. "
India Looks To Buy More Iranian Oil As Spat With Saudis Escalates.html,"India is at the ready to purchase more Iranian oil immediately if U.S. sanctions on Iran are lifted, a government official has threatened in the latest escalation of the India-Saudi spat over crude oil. India’s refiners have already been instructed to purchase less crude oil from Saudi Arabia after a war of words between the two over oil policies. India has for months pushed its main suppliers—Saudi Arabia and Iraq—to ramp up oil production to keep oil prices manageable for the world’s third-largest oil importer. The plea came after Saudi Arabia boosted oil prices by agreeing to voluntarily cut an additional million barrels per day on top of its production cut quota. Saudi Arabia responded to India’s call to action by raising its official selling price. Game on. India’s next move was to tell its refiners to reduce the amount of oil purchased from Saudi Arabia in May—and indeed they did. India’s refiners are set to purchase 36% less Saudi crude in May than previously planned.
 Meanwhile, India’s oil imports from the United States have climbed in recent months, catapulting the United States into position to become India’s second-largest oil supplier behind Saudi Arabia. India’s purchases of oil from Saudi Arabia already dropped by 42% in February.  India’s imports of Iraq oil also dropped—by 23%--in February, according to Reuters data. Some speculated at the time that India’s lower purchases in February were because India was holding out for lower prices should OPEC decide to ease its production cuts.  Related: UAE Presents Phenomenal Plan To Boost Its Position As Oil Hub OPEC did, but not by enough to sink oil prices.
 But India’s plan to purchase more Iranian crude has flaws. One legitimate concern is that many industry analysts suspect that Iran is already producing and exporting a serious amount of crude oil—under the literal radar. This would leave only a modest amount for Iran to add to its exports should the U.S. sanctions be lifted. Others have suggested that India has already begun to import sanctioned Iranian crude oil under the assumption that trade with Iran will be allowed to continue. India, which has complied with the U.S. sanctions on Iran, has been hard-hit by the sanctions that have limited its oil purchasing avenues, increasing its reliance on Saudi oil. Meanwhile, the world’s largest oil importer, China, has continued to purchase Iran’s oil despite the sanctions—at a deep discount, no doubt—giving it a leg up on its more compliant, Asian oil-buying competitor, India. "
Optimism Grows Over Oil Demand Recovery.html,"OPEC and partners are betting on a significant boost in oil demand over the coming months as member states get ready to ramp up oil production.  OPEC, Russia, and their allies are planning to increase oil production by 2.1 million bpd by as early as July this year, suggesting the confidence they have in a market rebound. The organization’s output cuts of 7 million will be eased significantly each month between now and July.  Saudi Arabia is also expected to ease its voluntary output cuts to increase production by 1 million bpd by July.  The announcement to ease restrictions comes unexpectedly as the oil industry is once again suffering from increased Covid-19 restrictions as Europe and parts of Latin America go into a third wave of the pandemic.  Oil prices have dropped to the lowest in almost two weeks as European lockdown measures continue to be extended, leaving the market unsure of upcoming demand trends. Futures in New York fell 4.6 percent on Monday, from $64.86 a barrel on April 1 to $62.15, which decreased oil prices to below the U.S. crude’s 50-day moving average.
 OPEC will be hoping that prices remain generally high as production increases, relying on the international market to soak up the higher crude production by the summer months. However, it will be battling with restrictions on travel, closed businesses, and the new working-from-home norm.   Related: Iran’s Comeback To Oil Markets Unlikely To Cause Price Crash However, optimism around the vaccine rollout continues, as the U.K. has given the first vaccine to almost half of the population, and the U.S. to over 30 percent of the population. While vaccination programs in the rest of Europe and North America are moving at a slower rate, there is still hope that many countries will catch up by late 2021.  Vitol, the world's biggest independent oil trader, stated this week that it expects oil demand to increase over the next decade but warns jet fuel recovery will be slower. While certain oil sectors will remain stagnant, others are expected to increase, including light ends used in manufacturing.  Platts Analytics is also optimistic about the 2021 rebound, anticipating an oil demand growth of 5.9 million bpd this year, in comparison to the 9 million bpd decrease experienced in 2020. The firm expects demand to climb steadily before plateauing at an estimated 113.5 million bpd in the late 2030s.
 The increase in demand will come predominantly from Asia, as China and India’s energy needs are steadily increasing as already developed markets, such as Europe and North America, are expected to stagnate.   OPEC+ is looking increasingly toward India and its oil refiners, as Saudi Arabia hopes to forge strategic relations with one of the fastest-growing downstream markets in the world. At present, the Arab Gulf States account for around 20 percent of India’s total import bill, which is dominated by oil and gas.  While Covid-19 restrictions continue to hamper oil demand, optimism around the vaccine rollout as well as increased demand from emerging markets suggests OPEC’s plan to ramp up production will be met with enthusiasm. "
Optimism Returns To Canadas Oil Industry.html,"Optimism is returning to the Canadian oil industry as demand rebounds and production follows, Bloomberg has reported, citing the chief of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. ""There's no denying that we've been beaten, battered and wounded and industry was faced with some of the biggest challenges last year we've ever seen,"" Tim McMillan said at the Scotiabank CAPP Energy Symposium. ""Our industry still has its best days ahead of it. In fact, over the past year, our industry has rallied and we're approaching a future with cautious optimism,"" the CAPP chief executive added. Even so, things are beginning to look up for an industry that was struggling to stay profitable even before the pandemic as pipeline shortages kept costs high, and emissions-cutting plans at the federal level threatened long-term profitability.
 Many Canadian oil companies will remain focused on cost cuts, Bloomberg reported, citing attendees of the CAPP conference. Shareholder returns will continue to be another priority at the expense of production growth plans. As part of cost cuts, some of which have been effected through mergers and acquisitions, Canada's oil industry is shedding jobs. Some 7,300 jobs could be lost this year, the Petroleum Labour Market Information division of Energy Safety Canada said last month. More than a thousand of these job losses will come from Suncor, which last year cut 600 jobs and said it aimed to cut 1,930 over 18 months. Cenovus is cutting between 1,720 and 2,150 jobs after its takeover of Husky Energy.
 According to data from PetroLMI, the oil and gas industry of Alberta has shed a total of 36,000 jobs since a peak hit in December 2013, when it employed 171,000 people. By February 2021, this had fallen to a bit over 134,000. In August 2014, before the oil price crash happened, Canada's oil industry employed 229,000 people directly. Since then, this has fallen by 26 percent."
Rising Fuel Stocks Push Oil Prices Lower.html,"Crude oil prices fell on Wednesday after the Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory draw of 3.5 million barrels for the week to April 2 along with a hefty gasoline stock increase and a build in distillates. This compares with an inventory decline of 900,000 barrels reported for the previous week and analyst expectations for an inventory draw of 1.325 million barrels for the period. A day earlier, the American Petroleum Institute had estimated a crude oil inventory draw of 2.62 million barrels but a much larger build in gasoline stocks, which put additional pressure on prices already weighed down by soaring Covid-19 infection numbers in several big markets. In gasoline, the EIA estimated an inventory build of 4 million barrels for the reporting period, compared with a 1.7-million-barrel decline a week earlier. Gasoline production averaged 9.3 million bpd last week, a slight decline on the week before.
 In a separate report, the EIA said this week that it expected gasoline consumption during the summer to improve further, after already rising from 7.7 million bpd in January to 8.6 million bpd in March. In middle distillates, the authority reported an estimated inventory build of 1.5 million barrels for the week to April 2. This compared with a build of 2.5 million barrels for the prior week. Middle distillate production averaged 4.6 million bpd last week, down from the previous week when output averaged 4.7 million bpd. Oil prices have been enjoying the effects of economic optimism in the United States, with jobs data for March suggesting hiring is strong, even though it has yet to catch up with pre-pandemic levels of employment, and the economy is on track to post strong growth this quarter and later on in the year.
 On the flip side, infection numbers are still on the rise in many parts of the world, including much of the U.S., which is having a negative effect on prices. At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $62.48 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at $59.03 a barrel, both slightly down from the opening of trade."
UAE Presents Phenomenal Plan To Boost Its Position As Oil Hub.html,"Three key developments were announced last week by the UAE in line with its role as a principal member of the U.S.’s new Middle East strategy to counter China’s dramatically increasing influence over the region: plans for a major economic expansion; plans to attract more oil trade into new contracts; and plans to counter Iranian threats to oil supplies through the Strait of Hormuz.  The first of these developments - announced by UAE Vice President and Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, vice president and prime minister of the UAE and ruler of Dubai – is ‘Operation 300 Billion’. This is an initiative that intends to raise the contribution of the UAE’s industrial sector to AED300 billion (US$81 billion) from the current AED133 billion within the next 10 years. The objective will be achieved in large part through the creation of 13,500 industrial companies over that period, covering the manufacturing, construction, electricity, gas, mining and quarrying sectors in the first instance. At the centre of these plans, which in turn fall within the UAE’s Circular Economy Policy 2021-2031, will be an adjunct build-out of the UAE’s energy sector. This includes an overall target crude oil production increase for the UAE’s flagship oil and gas company – the Abu Dhabi Oil Company (ADNOC) – from around 4 million barrels per day (bpd) to at least 5 million bpd by 2030 at the latest.  Related: Record High COVID Cases Could Stall India’s Oil Imports Much of this increase – and similar increases that will come from the other Arab states that align decisively with the U.S. through its sponsored ‘relationship normalisation deals’ – will be geared towards India as the prime end-user in the East that is being cultivated by the U.S. to become a more active regional rival to neighbouring China. The 15 June 2020 clash between military units of the two great Asia powers in the disputed territory of the Galwan Valley in the Himalayas reflected a much greater change in the core relationship between the two countries than the relatively small number of casualties might have implied. It marked a new ‘push back’ strategy from India against China’s policy of seeking to increase its economic and military alliances from Asia through the Middle East and into Southern Europe, in line with its multi-layered multi-generational ‘One Belt, One Road’ (OBOR) project.
 Until China dramatically upped the tempo of this OBOR-related policy – at around the same time as the U.S. signalled its lack of interest in continuing its own large-scale activities in the Middle East through its withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran and its withdrawal from much of Syria – India had stuck to a policy of trying to contain China. A series of reports recently on the expected growth in India’s demand for oil, gas, and other energy products will allow it to occupy this position as a viable alternative end-user for China and to advance a more aggressive version of its own rival policy to China’s OBOR strategy – India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ initiative. Since the UAE signed its own ‘relationship normalisation’ deal with Israel, its flagship oil producer, ADNOC, now plays a key role in the management of India’s vital strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) and a slew of new oil deals are expected between the UAE and India. Following on from this, ADNOC’s chief executive officer, Sultan al-Jaber, stated at the end of March that the new investments to be made by the UAE, along with new conventional and unconventional oil discoveries, will help boost the production of Murban. This dovetails into the second key development announced last week, which was the finalisation of plans to attract more oil trade into new contracts. Specifically, last week saw the launch by ADNOC of a dedicated Murban futures contract on a new Abu Dhabi-based exchange – the ICE Futures Abu Dhabi platform (IFAD) - in partnership with the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).  Related: Goldman Sachs Sees Large Oil Demand Rebound This Summer The light, sweet Murban crude oil grade is one of the four crudes produced by ADNOC, although it accounted for around half of the UAE’s total near-4 million bpd crude oil production before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to ICE and ADNOC, Murban futures is the second physically delivered futures contracts traded on a regional exchange after Dubai Mercantile Exchange’s Oman crude futures, and Murban is also a deliverable grade in the Platts benchmark Dubai and Oman crude assessments. ICE and ADNOC partnered with BP, GS Caltex, Inpex, ENEOS, PetroChina, PTT, Shell, Total and Vitol to launch the IFAD, and ICE has also announced agreements with Chevron, Trafigura, and Occidental to explore using the contract to price crude exports from the U.S. to Asia.
 The new Murban contract on the new IFAD exchange also then ties into the final part of the trio of announcements last week, with this being that the UAE’s Fujairah emirate is to dramatically expand over the next 10 years. Already the world’s third biggest bunkering centre, Fujairah is set to continue to benefit from its highly advantageous strategic position outside the perennially troublesome Strait of Hormuz and outside the rest of the Persian Gulf as well. Instead, Fujairah offers an unencumbered direct port on the eastern side of the Gulf of Oman, which means that any oil kept there will be able to avoid any blockade that Iran might again impose on ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz. This option will become increasingly attractive to Iran as it finalises its Guriyeh-Jask oil pipeline that will allow its oil to flow without going through the Strait even as it blockades 30 per cent of the rest of the world’s oil supply. Fujairah’s geographical position also allows any oil kept there to avoid any future problems that may arise with Oman if the Sultanate succumbs to China’s current wooing of it to become part of its OBOR-related sphere of influence. Even as it stands, Fujairah is the key hub from which the UAE’s Murban oil is exported, making its way there through the 360 kilometre Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline from the Habshan onshore field in Abu Dhabi and capable of transporting 1.8 million bpd. ADNOC is also currently developing underground oil storage caverns in Fujairah that can hold 42 million barrels, including Murban, with the project expected to be completed in 2022.  According to recent statements from the Fujairah port development authorities, it may add a tenth berth shortly as part of plans to boost overall storage capacity across the site to 17 million cubic metres in the next three to four years."
Irans Comeback To Oil Markets Unlikely To Cause Price Crash.html,"Oil investors now have to contend with another wildcard: Iran soon returning to the oil markets. After a three-year layoff, Iran could be poised to officially rejoin the ranks of oil exporters as early as 2021. But does it really portend oil price doom? Not necessarily.  Oil prices reacted positively after OPEC and its non-OPEC partners last week reached a favorable agreement to start gradually curbing production cuts beginning in May. Starting next month, OPEC+ will allow an additional 350,000 barrels per day to join the markets, with another 350,000 coming in June and June and 450,000 barrels per day slated for July.  Going by the margin of the increases, it's obvious that the alliance is trying to exercise plenty of caution to avoid upsetting a still-delicate market balance as the ongoing coronavirus crisis continues to cloud the market outlook.  The organization is currently holding back just over 7 million barrels per day, with OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia voluntarily cutting an additional 1 million barrels per day. Enter Iranian oil, which by all accounts has already reentered the oil export market in a sanctions-busting manner, thanks mainly to China.  Abbas Araghchi, Iran's deputy foreign minister for political affairs, has named the removal of Trump-imposed US sanctions as the only pre-condition before Iran can agree to scale back atomic activities under the 2015 nuclear deal, aka JCPOA. The United States, for its part, appears willing to play ball after president Joe Biden expressed support for a return to something similar to JCPOA. However, the Biden administration has been adamant that Iran must first take steps to return to compliance—a parameter that Tehran has rejected. Related Video: Saudi Arabia Goes All-In on Hydrogen Nevertheless, many experts expect the two nations to reach some form of agreement, which could see the oil sanctions lifted in the current year. In fact, E3+2 members of the nuclear deal (the UK, France, Germany, Russia, and China) are now getting together in Vienna to discuss what happens next, with the Biden administration also in Vienna, though there will be no face-to-face with the Iranians. 
 Before the sanctions, Iran was one of the world's leading crude exporters, capable of pumping in excess of 4 million barrels a day in its heyday. While the specter of millions of barrels flooding the market could be unsettling for the bulls—and quite capable of derailing OPEC's curtailment efforts--investors should probably not fret too much about it. Iran's crude exports Iran's Crude Oil: Exports from 2008 to 2019  Source: CEIC It's an open secret that Iran has been flouting U.S. sanctions by applying several cloaking methods to evade detection and sell its crude oil to China.  OPEC estimates that Iranian crude production in February clocked in at 2.14 million b/d, a 190,000 b/d increase from a 30-year low of 1.95 million b/d in August. Still, that's a long way off the 3.48 million b/d Iran pumped in 2016 and 3.79 million b/d in 2017. But here's the kicker: Some tanker tracker sources—which rely on satellite imagery to follow global oil shipments—are suggesting that Iran's oil exports are already fairly high, meaning we may not see a huge increase even if sanctions are lifted.
 Iran's crude and condensate exports were estimated at 825,000 b/d in Q1, a considerable improvement from 420,000 b/d in Q3 2020 but a far cry from the 2.125M b/d the country exported in 2017. You can bet that China is more than happy to take the bulk of this crude, especially since Iran sells it to Chinese refineries at a steep discount to Brent crude.  Related Video: The Conditions Are Ripe for A Second Shale Boom The relatively high level of exports amid those sanctions could mean that Iran is not desperate for a nuclear deal—and could in fact be hoping to prove that sanctions mean nothing.  Big wildcard Let's just say that at this point, Iran remains a big wildcard despite the lack of certainty that a deal with the U.S. will materialize anytime soon. It's not like Iran will lack buyers for its crude if it decides coming back to the market is a good idea. Bloomberg has reported that Iran has already contacted at least five of its old Asian customers to strike deals in anticipation of eased sanctions. China and India have traditionally been Iran's biggest buyers in Asia, followed by South Korea and Japan. India, the world's third-largest oil importer, will be hoping to diversify its crude sources and lower its reliance on Iraq and Saudi Arabia. But ultimately, Covid-19 will continue being the oil market's biggest wildcard. Neil Beveridge, senior oil and gas analyst at Bernstein Research, says demand could potentially increase by 4 to 5 million barrels as we get into 3Q and 4Q if Covid-19 vaccine rollout progresses smoothly—at which point it might not matter much what Iran does or fails to do. The United States has so far unveiled the world's fastest vaccine rollout as Bloomberg, placing itself in the best position for a re-opening economy. The latest vaccination rate stands at 3,053,566 doses per day, meaning it will cover 75% of the population, or the so-called herd immunity number, in just three months."
Russia OPEC To Gradually Ease Production Cuts In May July.html,"The OPEC+ alliance will gradually ease the collective production cuts between May and July, as the ministers agreed earlier this month, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told reporters on Friday. The decision was taken by OPEC+, and the gradual reversal of part of the cuts will take place between May and July, Novak said, as carried by the Russian news agency Interfax. Russia, the key partner of OPEC in the OPEC+ group, decided together with its allies led by Saudi Arabia to ease the collective production cuts by over 1 million barrels per day (bpd) over the next three months to July.
 In early April, OPEC+ decided to gradually increase collective oil production by 350,000 bpd in each of May and June and by more than 400,000 bpd in July. Additionally, Saudi Arabia will also gradually ease its extra unilateral cut of 1 million bpd over the course of the next few months, beginning with monthly production increases of 250,000 bpd in each of May and June. Before the OPEC+ meeting that agreed on these parameters, Novak said that the situation on the global oil market had improved since the March meeting. There are still many uncertainties on the global oil market, especially in Europe, Russia’s top oil diplomat said, but noted that there is currently a deficit of 2 million bpd on the market. Novak also said at that meeting that he expects global oil demand to increase by 5 million bpd-5.5 million bpd this year compared to last year.
 This week, OPEC raised its global demand growth estimate, and so did the International Energy Agency (IEA), giving the market hope that demand would rebound strongly later this year and offset the weakness seen in the first half due to surging cases and lockdowns in Europe and major oil importer India. The IEA now sees oil demand rising by 5.7 million bpd in 2021 compared to 2020, revising up its estimate by 230,000 bpd “to take account of better economic forecasts and robust prompt indicators.”"
Oil Demand Could Peak By 2026 Goldman Sachs.html,"Despite a bullish stance on the short-term future of oil demand, Goldman Sachs has a grimmer prediction for the longer-term future of the commodity: in a Bloomberg report, the investment banking major was quoted as expecting “anemic” demand for oil from the transport sector after 2025. “Government policies driving higher efficiency gains and lower emissions have had the strongest bearing on road transport demand,” Goldman analysts said in the report. “Petrochemicals will become the new baseload for oil demand, driven by economic growth and rising consumption, especially in emerging markets.”
 The transport sector is the largest consumer of crude oil, but the wider adoption of electric cars will undermine demand, according to Goldman Sachs, and it could peak by 2026. As for a return of demand to pre-pandemic levels, this will not happen at all, according to the investment bank. In addition to rising electric vehicle sales, driven by tighter emissions regulation in Europe and the U.S., a permanent shift towards working from home for many in employment would also have a negative effect on oil demand, as 43 percent of oil consumption comes from passenger vehicles, the Bloomberg report noted.
 Over the short term, however, Goldman is pretty bullish on oil. The bank said earlier this month it expected a strong rebound in oil demand over the summer, noting this would require OPEC to relax its production controls further and bring back another 2 million bpd in the third quarter. Seeing as Iran plans to boost its own production by that many barrels daily, however, the cartel may need to keep the caps, all else being equal. As for prices, Goldman expects Brent to reach $75 per barrel in the third quarter thanks to the returning demand and to the brightening global economic outlook driven by government stimulus, notably in the United States."
3 Oil Stocks To Watch This Spring.html,"Oil bulls who have been praying for oil prices to cross the $70 per barrel mark to affirm a full recovery after a very encouraging 6 month-long rally have unfortunately been disappointed. Oil prices seem to have hit a ceiling at the high 60s and are currently flirting with the low 60s with a Covid-19 resurgence raining on the bulls' parade thanks to new lockdowns in key consumer regions such as India and the UK. Still, the U.S. oil and gas sector remains in good stead; J.P. Morgan has estimated that Permian's Delaware Basin oil drillers now require oil prices of just ~$33/bbl to break even down from $40/bbl in 2019. Indeed, JPM says most U.S. onshore operators are economic at current oil prices, and many operators are even likely to ramp up activity in H2 and build solid momentum for higher volumes in 2022. U.S. shale producers are likely to increase production in the coming months but will still maintain production discipline and come nowhere near pre-pandemic production levels. In fact, they could fall short by 7% in the Permian--the largest shale region--and a whopping 26% in the Eagle Ford--the second-largest shale play. Indeed, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) CEO Vicki Hollub recently conceded that returning to production levels of ~13M bbl/day achieved in Q1 2020 requires ""too much investment,"" something the sector can ill-afford under the current circumstances. And now, OPEC is predicting much stronger oil demand for 2021 ... Bearing that in mind, here are three oil-related investments that could weather temporary storms better than most ... #1 Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP) President Biden's administration is reportedly planning the first major tax increase in nearly three decades in the next economic stimulus package. The president is reportedly planning to include the first major tax hike since 1993 in the next spending bill following the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that Congress has already approved.
 In the oil and gas sector, the biggest winner yet in a Biden tax hike though would be Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs), well represented by the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP), a $4-billion passive fund holding stakes in 19 MLPs. MLPs are business ventures that operate as publicly traded companies, with the company that manages day-to-day operations being the general partner while the investor acts as a limited partner. The first MLP was formed by shale company Apache Corp. (NYSE:APA) in 1981. In recent years, MLPs have fallen out of favor after changes were made to the way partnerships are taxed and, perhaps more importantly, due to Trump's tax bonanza. In 2018, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reversed a key policy in MLP tax costs for interstate pipelines that led to increased cost of business for some companies.   Related: The World Still Needs Hundreds Of Billions Of Barrels Of Oil A tax hike could reverse some of the damage and significantly improve the value proposition of MLPs. According to CreditSights analyst Charles Johnston, Biden's tax plan would increase the tax advantage for MLPs over C-corps from around seven percentage points to 17. The Alerian MLP ETF offers a yield of around 7% but still appears cheap. #2 Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE:MMP) Yet another MLP, Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P.  (NYSE:MMP) is a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based company that engages in the transportation, storage, and distribution of refined petroleum products.
 There are several reasons why this might be a prime holding. MMP sports a current dividend yield of 9.13%, easily one of the highest in the sector, making it attractive for income investors. The company has ranked at, or near, the top of MLP yields and returns for about two decades, thanks to what Morningstar has attributed to MMP's management quality and capital allocation record. Further, MMP boasts a BBB+ credit rating or its equivalent from both S&P and Moody's(stable), good for a low default risk of 5%, one of the best in the industry.  Related: Oxford Institute: Don't Expect A Supercycle In Oil MMP is currently trading at under 9x cash flow, with 0.2% CAGR long-term growth chalked in. This essentially means that the stock is unlikely to become a gusher--but also offers pretty decent downside protection. #3 Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is an independent E&P company in the United States that engages in the exploration, production, and refining of crude oil and condensate, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. MRO owns the famous Sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through Karnes and Atascosa Counties. MRO stock has enjoyed a massive 161% rally over the past 12 months and 61% in the year-to-date thanks to massive improvements in crack spreads. Crack spreads have nearly doubled from $12 per barrel six months ago to $23 currently. Crack spreads refer to the overall price differential between the price of a barrel of crude oil and the price of petroleum products refined from it.  The ""crack"" is an industry term that refers to the process of breaking apart crude oil into different components, including gaseous products like propane, heating fuel, gasoline, light distillates like jet fuel, heavy distillates like grease and intermediate distillates like diesel fuel. MRO has been able to benefit from the rebound thanks to the company's efficient operations, low breakeven prices, and healthy free cash flow. This is a stock that could still see impressive upside should oil prices continue to rally to $70-$75."
Shell To Exhaust Dwindling Oil Gas Reserves By 2040.html,"Shell expects to have produced 75 percent of its current proved oil and gas reserves by 2030, and only around 3 percent after 2040, the supermajor said in its Energy Transition Strategy that it will put to a non-binding shareholder vote next month.    Discussing the risk of stranded assets in the energy transition, Shell said that every year it tests its oil and gas portfolio under different scenarios, including prolonged low oil prices, and cross-references assets with break-even prices to assess if they would still be viable in case of low oil and gas prices. At December 31, 2020, Shell estimated that around 70 percent of its proved plus probable oil and gas reserves, known as 2P, will be produced by 2030, and only 5 percent after 2040.   
 Shell’s proved oil and gas reserves have been declining in recent years, shrinking the reserves life to below eight years of production. In 2020, Shell’s proved reserves—taking production into account—decreased by 1.972 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) to 9.124 billion boe at December 31, 2020, the firm’s annual report showed.   That’s reserves for just seven years of production, lower than most peers.
 The declining reserves life is not unique for Shell. The largest international oil companies have seen their average crude reserves drop by 25 percent over the past five years, which could be a challenge for Big Oil’s production and earnings in the coming years, Citi said earlier this month. The supermajors reported lower reserves in their most recent reports, also due to the 2020 oil price and oil demand collapse, which forced all of them to write off billions of U.S. dollars off the value of assets.   In Shell’s case, the declining reserves life is not in contradiction to its assessment from earlier this year that its oil production peaked in 2019 and is set for a continual decline over the next three decades.  "
The Permian Faces An Empty Pipeline Crisis.html,"Just a few short years ago, the United States was producing more shale oil than ever, pumping as much and as quickly as they could to keep up with an industry and a market going gangbusters. At its height, U.S. crude production reached an apex of 13 million barrels per day (bpd). Even as oil price volatility and the short lifespan of shale wells caused plenty of small-scale booms and busts in the West Texas Permian Basin, the sector charged onwards with a steadfast growth mindset. More and more companies popped up to get in while the getting was good and pipeline companies laid down as much infrastructure as they could to keep up with shale’s rapid expansion. And then the COVID-19 pandemic arrived. In early 2020 the novel coronavirus took a massive bite out of global oil demand, and instead of banding together to keep the oil industry afloat, the leading OPEC+ members, Saudi Arabia and Russia, got into a spat that turned into an all-out oil price war, tanking global oil markets, flooding oil storage around the world, and ultimately pushing the West Texas Intermediate crude benchmark far past rock bottom and down to nearly $40 below zero per barrel on April 20, 2020. Some are now referring to that jaw-dropping crash as “Black April.” And indeed, it’s been a long, slow road to recovery since then - and the fact is, while oil prices have largely rebounded, it’s more than possible that the U.S. shale industry will never break its production records. Of course, U.S. shale isn’t dead, but it is far from a sure thing that the sector will ever be able to return to its full pre-pandemic glory. No one knows for certain whether we’re already experiencing peak oil, but there are plenty of experts that say if we haven’t already peaked, we can expect to in the very near future. At present, United States crude output is hovering around 11 million bpd. Some analysts are expecting more of a recovery in 2022, but very little growth is projected for the duration of this year. In fact, nearly half of all oil pipelines leading out of the Permian Basin are projected to run completely dry by the end of 2021, according to reporting by Reuters. 
  Related: Oxford Institute: Don't Expect A Supercycle In Oil “By the fourth quarter, total utilization of the largest oil pipelines from the Permian is expected to drop to 57%,” the report summarized findings from global energy research and consultancy group Wood Mackenzie. To put in perspective just how unprecedented of a downturn this is, at the worst point of the last market bust in 2016, pipelines were still running at 70 percent. So much oil pipeline capacity is now unused and unneeded, with no clear turnaround in sight, that major oil pipeline companies are casting about for other products to fill the lines and mulling over the possibility of selling stakes in operations in order to generate cash flow. 
 And the pipeline gap is only getting worse. More pipelines were already set to come online in this time frame, “growing the gap between production and capacity covered by long-term contracts to a record over 1 million bpd in February.” These developments have taken a massive toll on the bottom line for pipeline companies. “A lot of [pipeline] companies had to cut their dividends,"" said Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at TortoiseEcofin told Reuters. ""It has created some skepticism on the investor base about the sustainability of the sector."" If any sector is well-versed in the art of the boom-and-bust economy, it’s shale. If oil prices continue to rally and demand continues its steady climb back toward pre-pandemic levels, shale has proven time and again that it is more than capable of rising from the ashes. Some have even speculated that a shale exploration surge is on the horizon."
OPECs Bullish Demand Data Sparks Hope Of New Oil Rally.html,"OPEC has revised its 2021 oil demand upward to stand 190,000 bpd higher than last month's estimates, on the back of an economic rebound that surpasses last month's outlook. Global 2021 oil demand is now expected to average 96.46 million bpd for the full year, according to OPEC's latest projects included in its April Monthly Oil Market Report. That figure is up from 96.27 million bpd in last month's report, and up from the newly estimated 2020 oil demand figure of 90.51 million bpd. In last month's report, OPEC had estimated 2020 global oil demand at 90.39 million bpd. Behind the Curtain This upward revision comes after the group's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, told the group at the last OPEC meeting that the oil demand figures they were using were too low and that actual global oil demand would be higher. As the only true swing producer in the group, Saudi Arabia still has enormous sway within OPEC. The group ultimately decided to gradually lift oil production starting in May 2021 based on these figures, which it did not disclose at the time. Whatever spark, an optimistic oil demand projection by OPEC is bound to have a positive effect on prices.
 For its April MOMR, OPEC cited a ""stronger economic rebound than assumed last month."" Supporting this economic rebound, OPEC said, were stimulus programs, easing of Covid-19 lockdown measures, and accelerated vaccine rollout, particularly in the OECD region. Related Video: Iran’s Oil Exports Render Sanctions Irrelevant On the vaccine front, which OPEC cites as cause for oil demand optimism, an estimated 20% of the U.S. population has been fully vaccinated. In Israel, a whopping 57% of the population has been fully vaccinated. But overall, less than 10% of the world has received a single dose. Some countries are not expected to reach the 20% threshold by the end of 2021. The Sad Truth About H12021 While OPEC has adjusted up its oil demand projections for the whole year—and adjusted its production to match—it revised downward its oil demand projections for the first half of this year. Its reasons for lowering its H12021 projections seem to mimic the reasons it raised its full-year oil demand projections: Covid-19 measures in OECD Europe, and sluggish—actual—Q1 2021 demand data in the non-OECD region. And OPEC raised another caution flag in its report: ""Risk will remain high during 2021, subject to COVID-19 developments, and the pace of reaching heard immunity targets."" OPEC also pointed out additional risks that included new energy policies and the ""effectiveness of the large scale monetary and fiscal stimulus measures""—all of which will impact oil demand in the short-term. OPEC production
 While the data for the first part of 2021 showed worse oil demand than previously expected, OPEC's actual Q1 production for 2021 increased. OPEC's first-quarter production this year was 25.138 million bpd, compared to the previous quarter's 24.941 based on OPEC's secondary source figures.  Related: Oxford Institute: Don't Expect A Supercycle In Oil The countries showing increases in production of more than 100,000 bpd quarter on quarter are all the countries that are currently exempt from OPEC's production cut agreement. Iran, Libya, and Venezuela produced a combined average of 558,000 barrels per day more in Q1 2021 than they did in the last quarter of 2020.  The UAE also increased production by 96,000 bpd quarter over quarter. Iraq represented the fifth-largest increase at 64,000 bpd, while it was supposed to be producing under its quota to make up for previous overages as spelled out in the production cut agreement. Thankfully for OPEC, swing producer Saudi Arabia produced an average of 522,000 barrels per day less in Q1 2021 compared to Q4 2020. For the month of March, Iran, Angola, Iraq, and Libya saw the largest increase in crude production, while Saudi Arabia was, again, saw the largest decrease, bringing its March production to 8.090 million bpd. Overall, OPEC’s March production was 201,000 bpd higher than February, at 25.042 million bpd. This compares to an average 25.645 million bpd across all of 2020. OPEC’s production is expected to increase in the coming months after the last OPEC+ meeting agreed to ease up on the production cut quotas. In the first tranche of increases, an additional 500,000 bpd is expected—half from OPEC+ and half from Saudi Arabia’s voluntary cuts. Saudi Arabia, however, has signaled to the market that the group will be flexible with its production quotas to meet demand, wherever it may be."
Chinas Oil Imports Surge Ahead Of Refinery Maintenance Season.html,"China imported 11.69 million barrels of crude oil daily last month, up by 21 percent on the year, Reuters has reported, citing official customs data. Earlier this month, energy analytics services provider OilX calculated China’s March oil imports at 11.26 million bpd, noting, however, that these calculations did not include Iranian oil, which China has been buying in ever greater amounts.
 Despite being 21 percent higher on the year, the March average was lower than the average for February, which came in at 11.73 million barrels daily, Reuters noted. Analysts now expect a further slowdown in oil imports as refiners start seasonal maintenance. It’s also worth mentioning that March 2020 was a month of lockdowns in China, which severely affected the country’s oil consumption along with all other commodities. In addition to the seasonal factor, higher oil prices will also likely discourage a rebound in oil buying by Chinese refiners and traders, according to one analyst from energy consultancy FGE.
 There is also another factor that could see lower imports from “official” sources: China recently struck a massive investment deal with Iran and has been buying millions of barrels of Iranian crude on the quiet. Analysts believe that Iran has offered China significant discounts on its crude to stimulate more purchases, despite U.S. sanctions and warnings from Washington to stop buying Iranian crude. Discounts will be important as oil prices tick higher, hovering around $60 a barrel. On the other hand, a decline in Chinese imports for whatever reason would likely pressure prices, especially because it would coincide with OPEC+’s production increases that aim to return some 2 million bpd to global markets by July. This would be a welcome development for Chinese independent refiners, who are currently enjoying rising refining margins thanks to a pickup in construction activity across China after the end of winter."
Saudi Arabias Breakeven Oil Price To Drop To 65 Next Year.html,"Higher oil prices and an expected rebound in the global economy and oil demand are set to lower the fiscal breakeven oil price of the major Middle Eastern oil producers this year and next, with the breakeven oil price for Saudi Arabia dropping to $65.70 in 2022 from $77.90 in 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said. In its regional economic outlook published on Sunday, the IMF forecasts that all oil exporters from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)—except for Iran—will see their fiscal breakeven oil price, the oil price at which the fiscal balance is zero, lower in 2022 compared to previous years. The expectations are based on assumptions that the authorities will keep the current policies in place and that the simple average of the Brent, Dubai Fateh, and WTI crude oil prices would be $52.64 a barrel in 2021 and $50.07 a barrel in 2022.
 In the case of Saudi Arabia, the fiscal breakeven oil price is set to drop to as low as $65.70 next year, compared to $76.20 this year, and a high as $81.90 in the last pre-pandemic year 2019, according to the IMF. Saudi Arabia, however, is not the producer with the lowest breakeven prices. To compare, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is set to see its fiscal breakeven oil price at $60.40 next year, down from $68.20 in 2020 and $64.60 this year.  Related: Morgan Stanley: Oil Prices Stuck In $60 Range This Summer Qatar’s breakeven oil price is expected to drop to as low as $40.40 in 2022, from $46.20 in 2020 and $43.10 in 2021. Qatar has the lowest fiscal breakeven oil price among all MENA oil-exporting countries.
 While lower fiscal breakeven price is good news for all oil-dependent economies to balance their budgets, climate change and the energy transition are creating new challenges for the Middle Eastern petrostates, the IMF said. “The region’s oil exporters face the additional challenge of making the transition away from oil dependence as the world progressively shifts away from fossil fuels. Rebuilding financial buffers and pursuing economic and fiscal diversification while ameliorating any negative distributional impact on households, are key policy priorities in this regard,” the IMF noted.  "
The 7 Trillion Reason Saudi Arabia Is Cutting Oil Production.html,"Strict production discipline by OPEC and its partners is the #1 reason why oil prices have managed to stage a remarkable recovery and stay relatively high after plunging to historical lows in 2020. Early this month, oil prices reacted positively after OPEC and its non-OPEC partners, aka OPEC+, reached a favorable agreement to start gradually curbing production cuts beginning in May. Starting next month, OPEC+ will allow an additional 350,000 barrels per day to join the markets, with another 350,000 coming in June and June and 450,000 barrels per day slated for July. Currently, OPEC is holding back just over 7 million barrels per day, with Saudi Arabia voluntarily cutting an additional 1 million barrels per day. Indeed, the OPEC kingpin has since taken on voluntary cuts of 1 million barrels per day from the beginning of February. That marks a sharp turnaround from the Kingdom’s stance just a year ago when Riyadh and Moscow failed to agree to deep supply cutbacks in a bid to cope with falling oil demand leading to a supply glut and oil prices descending into negative territory for the first time in history. And it certainly appears like overkill bearing in mind that Saudi Arabia has some of the lowest production costs anywhere in the world. However, Saudi Arabia could be eyeing an even bigger prize with its generous cuts.  Related: Italian Oil Heiress Arrested In Major Mafia Bust Diversifying the economy Whereas Saudi Arabia, the region’s largest economy of the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) boasts the largest economy and the lowest production costs of any Arab nation, the harsh reality is that the country needs significantly higher oil prices than the current WTI price of $59.50 per barrel to balance its books. Indeed, Saudi Arabia’s fiscal breakeven price of $76.10 per barrel means that it remains heavily in the red, with only Qatar being able to record a surplus thanks to its low breakeven point of $39.90 per barrel. Budget deficit
  Source: Reuters Saudi Arabia desperately needs higher oil prices not only to balance its books but also to lower its dependence on crude. That goal is even more critical now that Saudi Arabia is pushing a 7.2 trillion-dollar plan to diversify its economy, essentially requiring state companies to cut dividends they pay the government in order to boost spending. For a company like Saudi Aramco--whose $75 billion dividends last year were the highest for state revenues--any reduction in dividends would need to be compensated by higher oil prices to boost transfers to the sovereign through taxes and royalties instead. Saudi Arabia has a target to boost domestic spending to 27 trillion riyals ($7.2 trillion) by 2030 as the world’s biggest oil exporter seeks to tame a huge deficit caused by lower oil revenues and weak demand due to the pandemic. Related Video: Iran’s Oil Exports Render Sanctions Irrelevant To achieve its goal, Saudi Arabia needs to curb supply over the coming years in a bid to boost oil prices. The fiscal benefits of higher oil prices can easily outweigh the impact of lower oil production on the economy. Whereas Saudi companies participating in the new programme have the liberty to decide how to fund their investments, the most likely avenues are dividends, soft loans, debt, and other financial instruments.
 Further, Saudi Arabia desperately needs to boost investments coming into the country (FDI) by nearly 100x, from $5.5 billion last year to FDI flows of over $500 billion over the next decade. Betting on clean energy On the energy front, Saudi Arabia is clearly committed to moving from crude to cleaner energy sources. The Saudi government has announced plans to build a $5 billion green hydrogen plant that will power the planned megacity of Neom when it opens in 2025. Dubbed Helios Green Fuels, the hydrogen plant will use solar and wind energy to generate 4GW of clean energy that will be used to produce hydrogen. But here’s the main kicker: Helios could soon produce hydrogen that’s cheaper than oil. Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) estimates that Helios’ costs could reach $1.50 per kilogram by 2030, way cheaper than the average cost of green hydrogen at $5 per kilogram and even cheaper than gray hydrogen made from cracking natural gas. Saudi Arabia enjoys a serious competitive advantage in the green hydrogen business thanks to its perpetual sunshine, wind, and vast tracts of unused land. In fact, Saudi Aramco has told investors that it has abandoned immediate plans to develop its LNG sector in favor of hydrogen. Aramco has said that the Kingdom’s immediate plan is to produce enough natural gas for domestic use to stop burning oil in its power plants and convert the remainder into hydrogen. Blue hydrogen is made from natural gas either by Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) or AutoThermal Reforming (ATR), with the CO2 generated captured and then stored. As the greenhouse gasses are captured, this mitigates the environmental impacts on the planet. Saudi Arabia clearly has its eyes on a future whereby the economy will stop relying too heavily on oil. Whether or not it will remain committed enough to achieve its long-term goal is another question."
Enis Latest Oil Discovery Could Be Big For Angola.html,"Italian firm Eni has made a new light oil discovery off the coast of Angola after exploration activities recommenced following a year of pandemic restrictions.  The discovery, made on Tuesday, is in Angola’s deepwater Block 15/06. Eni believes the exploration well, drilled at 500 metres in the Cuica exploration prospect, could hold as much as 200 to 250 million barrels of oil and presents the second big oil discovery in the area.   ""The well-head location, intentionally placed close to East Hub’s subsea network, will allow a fast-track tie-in of the exploration well and relevant production, thus immediately creating value while extending the Armada Olombendo FPSO production plateau. It is expected that production will start within six months after discovery,"" Eni stated.  Eni, which has been an active part of the country’s oil industry since 1980, produces around 120,000 bpd of oil in Angola. The firm has announced an anticipated $7 billion investment in Angola by 2025 in the areas of research, production, refining and solar energy, with the objective of cutting carbon emissions, job creation and diversifying the economy. As well as being an OPEC member, Angola is the second largest oil producing country in sub-Saharan Africa, producing an estimated 1.37 million bpd of oil and around 17,904 million cubic feet of natural gas. However, production in the country has been far below its full potential due to low investment in recent years owing to the drop in oil prices. 
 In January, Angola received IMF approval for a disbursement of over $480 million under a $3.7 billion loan agreement due to the ongoing struggle with low oil prices as well as weak exports.  To attract greater investment, the Angolan government has launched a new strategy with the aim of increasing production, hoping to tap into 57 billion barrels in undiscovered oil reserves. The government has also amended its legal and fiscal terms to make it easier for foreign companies to invest in the oil and gas sector, attracting firms with the country’s competitive production costs.  Greater investment is expected for 2021, for a country with a substantial oil potential, with 9 billion barrels of proven oil resources. There are also significant opportunities for refined petroleum products as Angola imports 80 percent of its needs in this area at present.  Related: Oil Demand Boosted By Highest Number Of Flights Since COVID Started Last month, Angola's National Agency for Oil, Gas and Biofuels (ANPG) released its timeline for the evaluation of its 2020 oil and gas licensing round. ANGP is hoping to expand oil research and evaluation programmes in sedimentary basins, better understand the country’s hydrocarbon potential and attract new investors in line with its Hydrocarbon Exploration Strategy 2020-2025.
 In early April, Angola announced that is has begun initiatives to develop its marginal fields, creating opportunities in nine blocks with an expected investment of $67.4 billion over the next five years.  The country is also expected to see a return on its renewable energy investment, with solar power production expected from 2022. Major energy firms Eni and Total both have a stake in the country’s solar energy sector in the provinces of Namibe and Huíla respectively. Angola has a significant untapped oil potential which has experienced underinvestment due to the volatility of oil prices over the last five years. However, the government is going full throttle on its oil and gas investment plan for 2021. This paired with new discoveries by oil major Eni, as well as advances in renewables, makes Angola the African oil giant to watch over the next five years. "
Iran Could Soon Officially Return 2 Million Bpd Of Oil To Global Markets.html,"Iranian crude could return to global markets sooner rather than later as this week’s start of negotiations between Tehran and the five world powers that, together with the U.S. signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that put an end to Iran’s nuclear ambitions in 2015. The Oil and Gas Journal reports, citing oil analytics firm Kpler, that the start of negotiations is a positive sign for things to come: soon, Tehran and Washington could too sit at the negotiating table. If this happens and they reach an agreement on Iran’s nuclear plans, some 2 million bpd of Iranian crude could be added to OPEC’s total. The talks were held in Vienna earlier this week, and Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani said, as quoted by CNBC, they were a success and that they opened a new chapter in efforts to save the so-called Iran nuclear deal.
 Both Tehran and the new administration in Washington have signaled they are ready to start negotiating the lifting of U.S. sanctions and Iran’s oil industry’s return to normal operation. However, both sides insist that the other one makes the first move: Iran wants the U.S. to first lift sanctions before it stops enriching uranium, and the U.S. wants Iran to first stop enriching uranium before it lifts the sanctions. Related Video: Iran’s Oil Exports Render Sanctions Irrelevant Yet not everything has been smooth. An attempt by Washington to offer a sort of an olive branch to Tehran failed earlier this year. The attempt consisted of the U.S. side offering Tehran to unfreeze $1 billion in oil revenues blocked under the sanction regime, but Tehran called the proposal ridiculous.
 It is important for both sides to settle their differences sooner rather than later. Iran is preparing for elections, and if the current government is replaced with a more conservative one, negotiations will become a lot harder. If they succeed, however, OPEC will have a problem on its hands, although it may not be as big as some would expect. Iran is already exporting more oil than official numbers would suggest, mostly to China.  This oil will simply come to light once the sanctions are lifted. Perhaps a bigger problem, for U.S. oil producers at least, is that Iranian oil will start flowing to India as well, and may displace some U.S. volumes that India has been taking in after it stopped its purchases from Iran because of the U.S. sanctions."
Many Drilled US Wells Will Never Be Completed.html,"Fracking crews are increasing their activity in U.S. shale basins, finishing off a slew of DUC wells, according to the EIA’s latest Monthly Drilling Report. As oil and gas companies focus on finishing off wells they’ve already drilled, on the sidelines, observers are wondering whether this is a fluke or whether the industry has really learned its lesson about drilling rigs that they do not intend to complete.  Are we seeing typical industry behavior, which may indicate that we are in for another DUC increase now that drilling activity has picked up? Tackling the Fracklog The way to describe the DUC count is a “fracklog” because it measures the number of wells that have been drilled but not yet completed—essentially creating a backlog of half-finished wells that are not producing oil or gas. The higher the DUC count, the more money oil companies have spent drilling wells that are not yet working—ostensibly while drilling more wells, which they also may not complete. For the U.S. shale industry, the DUC count has been a bellwether for the oil industry; the higher the DUC count, the more money oil and gas companies are sinking into wells that are stuck in limbo and not producing. This could either mean fiscal irresponsibility or a rapidly changing shift in the markets that too quickly rendered wells once deemed wise as obsolete. Of course, there are always DUCs. The logistics behind scheduling drilling and completion crews necessitate a certain number of drilled wells be made available to later complete. Companies often like to keep several months of drilled wells in inventory. And most wells that are drilled are finished within a year. Related Video: The Conditions Are Ripe for A Second Shale Boom 
 But an excessive number of DUCs could signify that something is amiss in the industry. The Whole Story The true fracklog didn’t boom during the pandemic. The DUC counts started climbing ever higher sometime in 2017—around the time the U.S. shale industry was catching flack for out of control debt loads.   True, during the pandemic, there were certainly a high number of DUCs. But the EIA reported DUC count of 7,685 in July 2020—after oil demand crashed, rendering foolish the process of spending more money to complete a well that a company didn’t need for production—is just par for the course, according to earlier EIA data. According to the EIA, the DUC count has been over 7,500, for the most part anyway, since mid-2018. The Dead DUC is Still a DUC But there are some, like Raymond James analyst John Freeman, who claimed this year in a note to clients that the United States’ true DUC count is much lower, given that many of the wells included in the EIA’s DUC count are dead in the water and many years old, likely never to be completed. According to Freeman, this figure is as much as 22% too high. A 2019 Federal Reserve of Dallas survey of oil and gas company executives suggests that half of the respondents agree that the EIA is overestimating the number of DUCs.  Related: Investors Rush To Oil Stocks Despite ESG Push In a low oil price environment, oil and gas companies may spend money on finishing off an already drilled well, rather than on drilling a new well. But companies will continue to strive to keep that DUC inventory in their back pocket should the market call for it. But when oil prices have been low for a long time—and demand for crude or gas remains low, those low oil prices may never justify completing a well, resulting in another dead DUC.
 Still, those DUCs are counted. Where We Are Now In 2014, the number of wells being drilled exceeded the DUC count. When drilling slowed at the end of that year, the number of DUCs continued to rise. There was a period leading up to 2017 that saw a dip in the DUC count. But before too long, DUCs were again on the rise.  The latest data suggests that the number of DUCs began to fall in July 2020 as oil inventories boomed, oil prices were ultra-low, and drilling and fracking activity had slowed to levels not seen in years. The DUC count has continued to fall since then, while drilling and completion activities have started to pick up. The gap between drilling and completion activity has closed over the last few years, while the gap between drilling activity and DUCs has inverted.   But there is an unmistakable correlation between drilling activity and DUCs, with an anywhere from 20 to 50-week lag from rig count shifts to corresponding DUC shifts. If that pattern holds true, we may be in for another increase in the number of DUCs in the next few months. Unless, that is, the EIA revaluates the method it uses for establishing its DUC counts. Or, as some suggest, shale has learned to belt tighten, and spending is shifted more heavily toward completing rather than drilling."
UAEs Oil Giant Looks To List Drilling Business In Local IPO.html,"Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is talking to banks about the potential listing of its oil drilling unit on the local stock exchange, Reuters reported on Thursday, quoting three sources with knowledge of the plan. ADNOC Drilling is the largest drilling company in the Middle East, it says, and operates 63 onshore rigs, 20 offshore jackup rigs, and 11 island rigs. ADNOC Drilling provides drilling rigs and associated services to companies part of the ADNOC Group, and helps the oil firm of OPEC member the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to reach its production targets, the drilling firm says.   According to two of Reuters’ sources, ADNOC would like to have the initial public offering (IPO) take place this year. The size of the offering could be larger than US$1 billion, one source told Reuters, but added that the talks with the banks were at their early stages.
 In recent years, ADNOC has moved to monetize some of its assets and resources by listing its distribution business, selling a minority stake in its pipelines business, and entering in joint ventures in the upstream and downstream. In December 2017, ADNOC listed its fuel retail unit ADNOC Distribution on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, setting an IPO offer price that valued the unit at US$8.5 billion. Last year, after oil prices crashed and OPEC+, including the UAE, had to curtail massive production volumes to rebalance the market and prop up oil prices, ADNOC announced a US$20.7-billion deal with six international companies for the acquisition of a minority stake in ADNOC Gas Pipeline Assets.
 Under the terms of the deal, Global Infrastructure Partners, Brookfield Asset Management, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, Snam, and NH Investment and Securities will acquire a 49-percent interest in ADNOC Gas Pipeline Assets, a new subsidiary of the UAE’s national oil and gas company."
Southeast Asia Looks To Increase Offshore Oil Production.html,"Malaysia and Brunei have signed an agreement to develop two offshore oil fields on the maritime boundary, with greater exploration of recent ultra-deepwater discoveries. The governments from both countries signed a unitisation agreement to develop the Gumusut-Kakap and Geronggong-Jagus East offshore oil fields. Development will be managed by Malaysian state-owned Petronas and Brunei’s National Unitisation Secretariat (NUS).  The agreement took place during Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin's visit to Brunei. It is one of several initiatives that was agreed upon during the official visit.   “Having now formalised this landmark agreement, PETRONAS believes that both parties can look forward to continuing the strong momentum towards developing our nations’ energy sectors for the long-term growth and prosperity of both Brunei and Malaysia.” Tengku Muhammad Taufik Tengku Kamadjaja Aziz, Petronas president and group CEO, said of the agreement. The Gumusut-Kakap field waters reach a depth of 1,200m, allowing for the development of two ultra-deepwater projects, Gumusut and Kakap. The field consists of 19 undersea wells. The maritime border location provides a new area of development for the oil industry in both countries. 
 Malaysia and Brunei are also expected to sign a memorandum of understanding on Transport Cooperation to develop their partnership in the areas of safety, security, intelligent transport systems and logistics. In addition, the two states could soon also reach a modernised Air Services Agreement and are expected develop their partnership to enhance gas resources across the two countries.  In the 23rd Annual Leaders' Consultation, held in Brunei, the national leaders from both states solidified existing commitments to information and communication technology, agriculture - food supply chains and distribution, trade and tourism.  Related Video: Iran’s Oil Exports Render Sanctions Irrelevant This is not the only oil project to come out of Brunei in recent weeks. In late March, the government of Brunei announced plans to triple oil production over the next five years as Brunei Shell Petroleum (BSP) began exploratory drilling in deepwater wells. BSP is preparing to drill deepwater exploration wells Merbah Deep-1 and Jagus Subthrust-1. The company has had a significant stake in Brunei oil since the discovery of the Seria field in 1929, with around 4,000 employees and over 20,000 contractors at present.
 Brunei’s Ministry of Energy said of the development last week, “Both exploration wells will form a key test in proving new hydrocarbon volumes and opening up the deepwater, further in alignment to the ministry’s strong emphasis to the operators to develop existing deepwater fields in the near to mid term”.  The government hopes to expand national production to 350,000 bpd equivalent by 2025, owing largely to deepwater digging. This is a significant increase from the 2020 dip to 105,100 bpd.  As well as being hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, with four consecutive quarters of negative growth in 2020, Brunei’s oil industry has been declining since 2006. However, greater investment from BSP and the new exploration agreement with Malaysia could see the oil and gas industry develop substantially over the next decade. "
India Looks To Buy More Iranian Oil As Spat With Saudis Escalates.html,"India is at the ready to purchase more Iranian oil immediately if U.S. sanctions on Iran are lifted, a government official has threatened in the latest escalation of the India-Saudi spat over crude oil. India’s refiners have already been instructed to purchase less crude oil from Saudi Arabia after a war of words between the two over oil policies. India has for months pushed its main suppliers—Saudi Arabia and Iraq—to ramp up oil production to keep oil prices manageable for the world’s third-largest oil importer. The plea came after Saudi Arabia boosted oil prices by agreeing to voluntarily cut an additional million barrels per day on top of its production cut quota. Saudi Arabia responded to India’s call to action by raising its official selling price. Game on. India’s next move was to tell its refiners to reduce the amount of oil purchased from Saudi Arabia in May—and indeed they did. India’s refiners are set to purchase 36% less Saudi crude in May than previously planned.
 Meanwhile, India’s oil imports from the United States have climbed in recent months, catapulting the United States into position to become India’s second-largest oil supplier behind Saudi Arabia. India’s purchases of oil from Saudi Arabia already dropped by 42% in February.  India’s imports of Iraq oil also dropped—by 23%--in February, according to Reuters data. Some speculated at the time that India’s lower purchases in February were because India was holding out for lower prices should OPEC decide to ease its production cuts.  Related: UAE Presents Phenomenal Plan To Boost Its Position As Oil Hub OPEC did, but not by enough to sink oil prices.
 But India’s plan to purchase more Iranian crude has flaws. One legitimate concern is that many industry analysts suspect that Iran is already producing and exporting a serious amount of crude oil—under the literal radar. This would leave only a modest amount for Iran to add to its exports should the U.S. sanctions be lifted. Others have suggested that India has already begun to import sanctioned Iranian crude oil under the assumption that trade with Iran will be allowed to continue. India, which has complied with the U.S. sanctions on Iran, has been hard-hit by the sanctions that have limited its oil purchasing avenues, increasing its reliance on Saudi oil. Meanwhile, the world’s largest oil importer, China, has continued to purchase Iran’s oil despite the sanctions—at a deep discount, no doubt—giving it a leg up on its more compliant, Asian oil-buying competitor, India. "
Optimism Grows Over Oil Demand Recovery.html,"OPEC and partners are betting on a significant boost in oil demand over the coming months as member states get ready to ramp up oil production.  OPEC, Russia, and their allies are planning to increase oil production by 2.1 million bpd by as early as July this year, suggesting the confidence they have in a market rebound. The organization’s output cuts of 7 million will be eased significantly each month between now and July.  Saudi Arabia is also expected to ease its voluntary output cuts to increase production by 1 million bpd by July.  The announcement to ease restrictions comes unexpectedly as the oil industry is once again suffering from increased Covid-19 restrictions as Europe and parts of Latin America go into a third wave of the pandemic.  Oil prices have dropped to the lowest in almost two weeks as European lockdown measures continue to be extended, leaving the market unsure of upcoming demand trends. Futures in New York fell 4.6 percent on Monday, from $64.86 a barrel on April 1 to $62.15, which decreased oil prices to below the U.S. crude’s 50-day moving average.
 OPEC will be hoping that prices remain generally high as production increases, relying on the international market to soak up the higher crude production by the summer months. However, it will be battling with restrictions on travel, closed businesses, and the new working-from-home norm.   Related: Iran’s Comeback To Oil Markets Unlikely To Cause Price Crash However, optimism around the vaccine rollout continues, as the U.K. has given the first vaccine to almost half of the population, and the U.S. to over 30 percent of the population. While vaccination programs in the rest of Europe and North America are moving at a slower rate, there is still hope that many countries will catch up by late 2021.  Vitol, the world's biggest independent oil trader, stated this week that it expects oil demand to increase over the next decade but warns jet fuel recovery will be slower. While certain oil sectors will remain stagnant, others are expected to increase, including light ends used in manufacturing.  Platts Analytics is also optimistic about the 2021 rebound, anticipating an oil demand growth of 5.9 million bpd this year, in comparison to the 9 million bpd decrease experienced in 2020. The firm expects demand to climb steadily before plateauing at an estimated 113.5 million bpd in the late 2030s.
 The increase in demand will come predominantly from Asia, as China and India’s energy needs are steadily increasing as already developed markets, such as Europe and North America, are expected to stagnate.   OPEC+ is looking increasingly toward India and its oil refiners, as Saudi Arabia hopes to forge strategic relations with one of the fastest-growing downstream markets in the world. At present, the Arab Gulf States account for around 20 percent of India’s total import bill, which is dominated by oil and gas.  While Covid-19 restrictions continue to hamper oil demand, optimism around the vaccine rollout as well as increased demand from emerging markets suggests OPEC’s plan to ramp up production will be met with enthusiasm. "
Optimism Returns To Canadas Oil Industry.html,"Optimism is returning to the Canadian oil industry as demand rebounds and production follows, Bloomberg has reported, citing the chief of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. ""There's no denying that we've been beaten, battered and wounded and industry was faced with some of the biggest challenges last year we've ever seen,"" Tim McMillan said at the Scotiabank CAPP Energy Symposium. ""Our industry still has its best days ahead of it. In fact, over the past year, our industry has rallied and we're approaching a future with cautious optimism,"" the CAPP chief executive added. Even so, things are beginning to look up for an industry that was struggling to stay profitable even before the pandemic as pipeline shortages kept costs high, and emissions-cutting plans at the federal level threatened long-term profitability.
 Many Canadian oil companies will remain focused on cost cuts, Bloomberg reported, citing attendees of the CAPP conference. Shareholder returns will continue to be another priority at the expense of production growth plans. As part of cost cuts, some of which have been effected through mergers and acquisitions, Canada's oil industry is shedding jobs. Some 7,300 jobs could be lost this year, the Petroleum Labour Market Information division of Energy Safety Canada said last month. More than a thousand of these job losses will come from Suncor, which last year cut 600 jobs and said it aimed to cut 1,930 over 18 months. Cenovus is cutting between 1,720 and 2,150 jobs after its takeover of Husky Energy.
 According to data from PetroLMI, the oil and gas industry of Alberta has shed a total of 36,000 jobs since a peak hit in December 2013, when it employed 171,000 people. By February 2021, this had fallen to a bit over 134,000. In August 2014, before the oil price crash happened, Canada's oil industry employed 229,000 people directly. Since then, this has fallen by 26 percent."
Rising Fuel Stocks Push Oil Prices Lower.html,"Crude oil prices fell on Wednesday after the Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory draw of 3.5 million barrels for the week to April 2 along with a hefty gasoline stock increase and a build in distillates. This compares with an inventory decline of 900,000 barrels reported for the previous week and analyst expectations for an inventory draw of 1.325 million barrels for the period. A day earlier, the American Petroleum Institute had estimated a crude oil inventory draw of 2.62 million barrels but a much larger build in gasoline stocks, which put additional pressure on prices already weighed down by soaring Covid-19 infection numbers in several big markets. In gasoline, the EIA estimated an inventory build of 4 million barrels for the reporting period, compared with a 1.7-million-barrel decline a week earlier. Gasoline production averaged 9.3 million bpd last week, a slight decline on the week before.
 In a separate report, the EIA said this week that it expected gasoline consumption during the summer to improve further, after already rising from 7.7 million bpd in January to 8.6 million bpd in March. In middle distillates, the authority reported an estimated inventory build of 1.5 million barrels for the week to April 2. This compared with a build of 2.5 million barrels for the prior week. Middle distillate production averaged 4.6 million bpd last week, down from the previous week when output averaged 4.7 million bpd. Oil prices have been enjoying the effects of economic optimism in the United States, with jobs data for March suggesting hiring is strong, even though it has yet to catch up with pre-pandemic levels of employment, and the economy is on track to post strong growth this quarter and later on in the year.
 On the flip side, infection numbers are still on the rise in many parts of the world, including much of the U.S., which is having a negative effect on prices. At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $62.48 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at $59.03 a barrel, both slightly down from the opening of trade."
UAE Presents Phenomenal Plan To Boost Its Position As Oil Hub.html,"Three key developments were announced last week by the UAE in line with its role as a principal member of the U.S.’s new Middle East strategy to counter China’s dramatically increasing influence over the region: plans for a major economic expansion; plans to attract more oil trade into new contracts; and plans to counter Iranian threats to oil supplies through the Strait of Hormuz.  The first of these developments - announced by UAE Vice President and Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, vice president and prime minister of the UAE and ruler of Dubai – is ‘Operation 300 Billion’. This is an initiative that intends to raise the contribution of the UAE’s industrial sector to AED300 billion (US$81 billion) from the current AED133 billion within the next 10 years. The objective will be achieved in large part through the creation of 13,500 industrial companies over that period, covering the manufacturing, construction, electricity, gas, mining and quarrying sectors in the first instance. At the centre of these plans, which in turn fall within the UAE’s Circular Economy Policy 2021-2031, will be an adjunct build-out of the UAE’s energy sector. This includes an overall target crude oil production increase for the UAE’s flagship oil and gas company – the Abu Dhabi Oil Company (ADNOC) – from around 4 million barrels per day (bpd) to at least 5 million bpd by 2030 at the latest.  Related: Record High COVID Cases Could Stall India’s Oil Imports Much of this increase – and similar increases that will come from the other Arab states that align decisively with the U.S. through its sponsored ‘relationship normalisation deals’ – will be geared towards India as the prime end-user in the East that is being cultivated by the U.S. to become a more active regional rival to neighbouring China. The 15 June 2020 clash between military units of the two great Asia powers in the disputed territory of the Galwan Valley in the Himalayas reflected a much greater change in the core relationship between the two countries than the relatively small number of casualties might have implied. It marked a new ‘push back’ strategy from India against China’s policy of seeking to increase its economic and military alliances from Asia through the Middle East and into Southern Europe, in line with its multi-layered multi-generational ‘One Belt, One Road’ (OBOR) project.
 Until China dramatically upped the tempo of this OBOR-related policy – at around the same time as the U.S. signalled its lack of interest in continuing its own large-scale activities in the Middle East through its withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran and its withdrawal from much of Syria – India had stuck to a policy of trying to contain China. A series of reports recently on the expected growth in India’s demand for oil, gas, and other energy products will allow it to occupy this position as a viable alternative end-user for China and to advance a more aggressive version of its own rival policy to China’s OBOR strategy – India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ initiative. Since the UAE signed its own ‘relationship normalisation’ deal with Israel, its flagship oil producer, ADNOC, now plays a key role in the management of India’s vital strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) and a slew of new oil deals are expected between the UAE and India. Following on from this, ADNOC’s chief executive officer, Sultan al-Jaber, stated at the end of March that the new investments to be made by the UAE, along with new conventional and unconventional oil discoveries, will help boost the production of Murban. This dovetails into the second key development announced last week, which was the finalisation of plans to attract more oil trade into new contracts. Specifically, last week saw the launch by ADNOC of a dedicated Murban futures contract on a new Abu Dhabi-based exchange – the ICE Futures Abu Dhabi platform (IFAD) - in partnership with the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).  Related: Goldman Sachs Sees Large Oil Demand Rebound This Summer The light, sweet Murban crude oil grade is one of the four crudes produced by ADNOC, although it accounted for around half of the UAE’s total near-4 million bpd crude oil production before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to ICE and ADNOC, Murban futures is the second physically delivered futures contracts traded on a regional exchange after Dubai Mercantile Exchange’s Oman crude futures, and Murban is also a deliverable grade in the Platts benchmark Dubai and Oman crude assessments. ICE and ADNOC partnered with BP, GS Caltex, Inpex, ENEOS, PetroChina, PTT, Shell, Total and Vitol to launch the IFAD, and ICE has also announced agreements with Chevron, Trafigura, and Occidental to explore using the contract to price crude exports from the U.S. to Asia.
 The new Murban contract on the new IFAD exchange also then ties into the final part of the trio of announcements last week, with this being that the UAE’s Fujairah emirate is to dramatically expand over the next 10 years. Already the world’s third biggest bunkering centre, Fujairah is set to continue to benefit from its highly advantageous strategic position outside the perennially troublesome Strait of Hormuz and outside the rest of the Persian Gulf as well. Instead, Fujairah offers an unencumbered direct port on the eastern side of the Gulf of Oman, which means that any oil kept there will be able to avoid any blockade that Iran might again impose on ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz. This option will become increasingly attractive to Iran as it finalises its Guriyeh-Jask oil pipeline that will allow its oil to flow without going through the Strait even as it blockades 30 per cent of the rest of the world’s oil supply. Fujairah’s geographical position also allows any oil kept there to avoid any future problems that may arise with Oman if the Sultanate succumbs to China’s current wooing of it to become part of its OBOR-related sphere of influence. Even as it stands, Fujairah is the key hub from which the UAE’s Murban oil is exported, making its way there through the 360 kilometre Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline from the Habshan onshore field in Abu Dhabi and capable of transporting 1.8 million bpd. ADNOC is also currently developing underground oil storage caverns in Fujairah that can hold 42 million barrels, including Murban, with the project expected to be completed in 2022.  According to recent statements from the Fujairah port development authorities, it may add a tenth berth shortly as part of plans to boost overall storage capacity across the site to 17 million cubic metres in the next three to four years."
Irans Comeback To Oil Markets Unlikely To Cause Price Crash.html,"Oil investors now have to contend with another wildcard: Iran soon returning to the oil markets. After a three-year layoff, Iran could be poised to officially rejoin the ranks of oil exporters as early as 2021. But does it really portend oil price doom? Not necessarily.  Oil prices reacted positively after OPEC and its non-OPEC partners last week reached a favorable agreement to start gradually curbing production cuts beginning in May. Starting next month, OPEC+ will allow an additional 350,000 barrels per day to join the markets, with another 350,000 coming in June and June and 450,000 barrels per day slated for July.  Going by the margin of the increases, it's obvious that the alliance is trying to exercise plenty of caution to avoid upsetting a still-delicate market balance as the ongoing coronavirus crisis continues to cloud the market outlook.  The organization is currently holding back just over 7 million barrels per day, with OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia voluntarily cutting an additional 1 million barrels per day. Enter Iranian oil, which by all accounts has already reentered the oil export market in a sanctions-busting manner, thanks mainly to China.  Abbas Araghchi, Iran's deputy foreign minister for political affairs, has named the removal of Trump-imposed US sanctions as the only pre-condition before Iran can agree to scale back atomic activities under the 2015 nuclear deal, aka JCPOA. The United States, for its part, appears willing to play ball after president Joe Biden expressed support for a return to something similar to JCPOA. However, the Biden administration has been adamant that Iran must first take steps to return to compliance—a parameter that Tehran has rejected. Related Video: Saudi Arabia Goes All-In on Hydrogen Nevertheless, many experts expect the two nations to reach some form of agreement, which could see the oil sanctions lifted in the current year. In fact, E3+2 members of the nuclear deal (the UK, France, Germany, Russia, and China) are now getting together in Vienna to discuss what happens next, with the Biden administration also in Vienna, though there will be no face-to-face with the Iranians. 
 Before the sanctions, Iran was one of the world's leading crude exporters, capable of pumping in excess of 4 million barrels a day in its heyday. While the specter of millions of barrels flooding the market could be unsettling for the bulls—and quite capable of derailing OPEC's curtailment efforts--investors should probably not fret too much about it. Iran's crude exports Iran's Crude Oil: Exports from 2008 to 2019  Source: CEIC It's an open secret that Iran has been flouting U.S. sanctions by applying several cloaking methods to evade detection and sell its crude oil to China.  OPEC estimates that Iranian crude production in February clocked in at 2.14 million b/d, a 190,000 b/d increase from a 30-year low of 1.95 million b/d in August. Still, that's a long way off the 3.48 million b/d Iran pumped in 2016 and 3.79 million b/d in 2017. But here's the kicker: Some tanker tracker sources—which rely on satellite imagery to follow global oil shipments—are suggesting that Iran's oil exports are already fairly high, meaning we may not see a huge increase even if sanctions are lifted.
 Iran's crude and condensate exports were estimated at 825,000 b/d in Q1, a considerable improvement from 420,000 b/d in Q3 2020 but a far cry from the 2.125M b/d the country exported in 2017. You can bet that China is more than happy to take the bulk of this crude, especially since Iran sells it to Chinese refineries at a steep discount to Brent crude.  Related Video: The Conditions Are Ripe for A Second Shale Boom The relatively high level of exports amid those sanctions could mean that Iran is not desperate for a nuclear deal—and could in fact be hoping to prove that sanctions mean nothing.  Big wildcard Let's just say that at this point, Iran remains a big wildcard despite the lack of certainty that a deal with the U.S. will materialize anytime soon. It's not like Iran will lack buyers for its crude if it decides coming back to the market is a good idea. Bloomberg has reported that Iran has already contacted at least five of its old Asian customers to strike deals in anticipation of eased sanctions. China and India have traditionally been Iran's biggest buyers in Asia, followed by South Korea and Japan. India, the world's third-largest oil importer, will be hoping to diversify its crude sources and lower its reliance on Iraq and Saudi Arabia. But ultimately, Covid-19 will continue being the oil market's biggest wildcard. Neil Beveridge, senior oil and gas analyst at Bernstein Research, says demand could potentially increase by 4 to 5 million barrels as we get into 3Q and 4Q if Covid-19 vaccine rollout progresses smoothly—at which point it might not matter much what Iran does or fails to do. The United States has so far unveiled the world's fastest vaccine rollout as Bloomberg, placing itself in the best position for a re-opening economy. The latest vaccination rate stands at 3,053,566 doses per day, meaning it will cover 75% of the population, or the so-called herd immunity number, in just three months."
Goldman Sachs Return Of Iranian Oil Wont Shock Markets.html,"Iranian oil potentially returning legitimately to the market will not be a shock and a complete return will not take place at least until the summer of next year, Goldman Sachs says, as the U.S. is taking part in indirect talks about the so-called Iran nuclear deal. “With OPEC+ appearing to manage its exit for now, supply concerns will likely shift to the potential return of Iran to the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) agreement,” analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note on Monday, as carried by Reuters. The United States is engaged in indirect talks about the Iran nuclear deal with diplomats from Europe, Russia, and China in Vienna.
 Currently, the U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump Administration are preventing Iran from exporting all of its oil, as many buyers around the world don’t want to risk their U.S. assets by doing business with Iran. U.S. President Joe Biden has signaled a willingness to return to the nuclear deal, but only if Iran returns to full compliance in its nuclear activities. “We don’t anticipate an early or immediate breakthrough, as these discussions we fully expect will be difficult. But we do believe that these discussions with our partners and, in turn, our partners with Iran is a healthy step forward,” Ned Price, U.S. State Department spokesman, said on Monday.
 According to Goldman Sachs, reaching an agreement that could lead to the U.S. potentially lifting the sanctions on Iran’s oil will likely take months. During that time, the OPEC+ group will monitor these events and will, if needed, tweak policies to accommodate Iranian supply, the investment bank says. Goldman Sachs continues to be bullish on oil and anticipates strong demand that would require OPEC+ putting another 2 million barrels per day (bpd) on the market in the third quarter, after the around 2 million bpd that the alliance and Saudi Arabia decided to return between May and July."
OPEC Meeting Saudis Look To Unwind Unilateral Output Cuts.html,"Oil prices gave up earlier gains and turned lower as of 11:39 a.m. EDT on Thursday, after reports emerged that Saudi Arabia was offering to gradually ease its additional unilateral cut of 1 million bpd, on top of the OPEC+ group also gradually easing the cuts in the next three months. The Saudis are proposing to ease the extra cut, beginning with lifting production by 250,000 bpd in each of May and June, on top of the OPEC+ group also easing the cuts, by 350,000 bpd in each of the next two months, Amena Bakr, Deputy Bureau Chief and Chief OPEC Correspondent at Energy Intelligence, reported, quoting sources. The OPEC+ collective production cut is expected to be eased to 5.6 million bpd in July, according to those sources. The OPEC+ alliance is reportedly debating raising its oil output by 350,000 bpd in each of May and June and by 400,000 bpd in July, a source told Reuters earlier today.  
 The market was more or less expecting a rollover of the current cuts or just a slight increase in view of the recent weakness in oil demand with European lockdowns and with Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, reiterating calls for a cautious approach today.

Commenting on the planned OPEC+ production rise in the next three months, Roger Diwan, Vice President at IHS Markit, tweeted:
 “Increasing production by ~1 million b/d over 3 months when product demand is expected to rise by ~3 million b/d over the same period is not bearish. It is conservative anticipation, but anticipation nonetheless.”  "
Oil Prices Rise As OPEC Agrees To Hike Output With 350000 Bpd In May.html,"The OPEC+ ministerial meeting is discussing gradual production increases over the next three months, sources say, while the group was still debating as of 11:10 a.m. EDT on Thursday how to proceed with its oil supply management policies.

Russia appeared more optimistic about oil demand recovery and the market as a whole, while Saudi Arabia hinted at a very cautious approach.
 The situation on the global oil market has improved since last month’s OPEC+ meeting, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said in his speech. But the Saudi minister said that “Until the evidence of the recovery is undeniable, we should maintain this cautious stance.” The Saudi remarks had analysts speculate that there would be another rollover of the current cuts. As the meeting advanced to the session closed to reporters, media outlets began to report various sources as saying that there would be an increase in the group’s production over the next three months.
 Saudi Arabia was also reportedly submitting a plan to ease its extra unilateral cut of 1 million bpd over the course of the summer. According to OPEC+ sources, the Kingdom will unwind its additional voluntary 1mn b/d cut by 250kb/d in May, 350kb/d in June, and 400kb/d in July. Oil markets continue to react with mixed feelings to the outcomes of the OPEC+ meeting, with both the WTI and Brent benchmarks rising up to 2% on the day before the news broke, but giving up some gains shortly after the group decided to gradually increase oil output over the next three months.  OPEC+'s decision to hike oil production by around 1 million bpd over the next three months may sound bearish to some, but given the increased demand for petroleum products in the U.S. and Asia this summer, it seems that a slight output increase is the most acceptable decision for most parties."
OPECs Production Rises In March As Iran Boosts Output.html,"A large increase in Iranian oil production pushed overall OPEC oil output higher in March compared to February, the monthly Reuters survey found on Wednesday, suggesting that higher supply from members exempt from the OPEC+ cuts could spoil the cartel’s efforts to rebalance the market. OPEC’s crude oil production increased by 180,000 barrels per day (bpd) from February to stand at 25.07 million bpd in March, according to the Reuters survey of OPEC sources, sources at oil firms, and tanker-tracking data. The biggest contributor to the higher OPEC production this month was Iran, whose supply increased by 210,000 bpd to 2.3 million bpd, offsetting cuts from other OPEC members. Iran’s production rise was also the single-largest jump in production among OPEC members. The second-biggest increase came from OPEC’s second-biggest producer, Iraq, which boosted production by 40,000 bpd, according to the Reuters survey.
 Libya and Venezuela, the other two OPEC members exempted from the OPEC+ cuts along with Iran, also saw small rises in their respective production. Last month, total OPEC oil production averaged 24.85 million bpd, a drop by 650,000 bpd compared to January, thanks to the extra cut from top producer and de facto leader Saudi Arabia, according to the cartel’s Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) for March. In February, all three OPEC members exempted from the OPEC+ cuts had also increased their oil production. In March, the Saudis achieved the 1-million-bpd additional cut, the Reuters survey found today.
 In recent months, Iran is estimated to have started to increase its oil production and significantly raise its oil exports to China, the world’s top oil importer. Some estimates suggest that China is set to import nearly 1 million bpd from Iran in March. Currently, Iran is masking the crude it sells to China as originating from other countries to avoid U.S. sanctions. It is also undermining the efforts of its fellow OPEC members to keep prices stronger."
OPEC Sees Slower Oil Demand Recovery Amid New Lockdowns.html,"An OPEC+ panel advising the group has revised down its global oil demand forecast for 2021 by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) in light of the renewed lockdowns in Europe amid a third wave of the pandemic, Reuters reported on  Wednesday, citing a report from the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) it had seen. The committee met on Tuesday, beginning the monthly OPEC+ meetings that are expected to decide how the alliance will proceed with the production cuts in May. “The most recent edition of OPEC’s Monthly Oil Market Report projecting growth of 5.1 per cent in 2021, while world oil demand is estimated to rise by 5.9 mb/d,” OPEC said at the end of the meeting.   But the JTC’s base-case scenario, according to the report Reuters has seen, now forecasts demand growth of 5.6 million bpd, down by 300,000 bpd. 
 Global oil supply, on the other hand, is set to rise by 1.6 million bpd this year, the JTC now expects. This is 200,000 bpd higher than its previous supply growth estimate. At the JTC meeting, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo “expressed cautious optimism about the positive trajectory of the recovery in the oil market and global economy,” OPEC said.  Related: Oil Prices Fall As Bearish Sentiment Returns One of the Arab Gulf members of OPEC, Kuwait, also said on Wednesday that it was “cautiously optimistic” about global oil demand growth this year, its Oil Minister, Mohammad Abdulatif al-Fares, said, as per Kuwait’s state news agency KUNA. Kuwait reiterated its full support to OPEC+ efforts to rebalance the market, the minister added.    The “cautious optimism” messages coming from OPEC and the OPEC+ group this week suggest that the group is more likely than not to roll over the current cuts into May, analysts say.  
 Russia is reportedly favoring a rollover of the alliance’s oil production cuts, but it is seeking a slight increase for itself to meet higher domestic seasonal demand, a source with knowledge of Moscow’s plans told Reuters on Monday. OPEC’s top producer and de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, is also reportedly ready to extend current OPEC+ production cuts over May and June and also keep cutting 1 million bpd in oil output unilaterally, according to an unnamed source who spoke to Reuters."
China Set To Buy 1 Million Bpd Of Cheap Iranian Crude This Month.html,"China’s crude oil imports from Iran this month could reach close to 1 million bpd, Reuters reported today, citing trading and analyst sources. That would be almost half the amount Saudi Arabia exports to China. An earlier report by Reuters from the beginning of the month said that China was buying record-high volumes of Iranian crude in anticipation of the Biden Administration lifting sanctions on Tehran. Even India, the report said, started planning for Iranian oil purchases. Later in March, Washington warned China to stop buying oil from Iran, according to a senior administration official.
 “We’ve told the Chinese that we will continue to enforce our sanctions,” the unnamed official told the FT. “There will be no tacit green light.”  The Trump-era sanctions may be waived if Iran and the U.S. make it to the negotiation table, but that still remains uncertain. “Ultimately, our goal is not to enforce the sanctions; it is to get to the point where we lift sanctions and Iran reverses its nuclear steps,” the official told the FT. Meanwhile, China is stocking up on cheap Iranian crude, most recently securing long-term supply with a deal worth $400 billion, under which China will invest heavily in various sectors of the Iranian economy over the next 25 years and will in exchange receive access to a steady flow of cheap oil.
 Currently, Iran is masking the crude it sells to China as originating from other countries to avoid U.S. sanctions. It is also undermining the efforts of its fellow members to keep prices stronger. “The recent jump in Iranian crude exports, notably to China, and crude going out of inventories are contributing to the weakness of the oil market, undermining OPEC+ efforts to limit supply and setting prices for a third weekly drop,” Rystad Energy said, as quoted by Reuters."
Saudi Arabia Ready To Extend Huge Oil Cuts Into June.html,"Saudi Arabia is reportedly ready to extend current OPEC+ production cuts over May and June and also keep cutting 1 million bpd in oil output unilaterally, according to an unnamed source who spoke to Reuters. OPEC+ hasn't significantly eased oil production since January when the collective output was increased by 500,000 bpd from 7.7 million bpd in December to 7.2 million bpd. Considering the still weak global demand, OPEC+ decided in January to give Russia and Kazakhstan small increases for February and March, keeping overall production little changed.  Since then, the cartel has remained cautious with any production changes as exempt OPEC members Libya and Iran kept increasing their production rates while the pandemic situation in some key markets remained more dynamic than oil producers would have liked.
 With some European countries tightening movement restrictions further amid yet another spike in infections and the United States also reporting higher new infection rates despite accelerating vaccinations, uncertainty about when oil demand will rebound has heightened. This is likely the primary factor determining Saudi Arabia's reported willingness to keep cutting at the present rate. Related Video: Nuclear fusion: The Unlimited Future ""They don't see demand as yet strong enough and want to prevent prices from falling,"" the Reuters source told the news agency.
 Yesterday, Reuters cited another unnamed source as saying that Russia, too, was willing to back a further extension of the current cuts, but it also wanted to secure approval for a moderate increase in its own production to respond to higher seasonal demand at home. The OPEC+ joint ministerial committee is meeting tomorrow to discuss production levels and the market situation ahead of the oil ministers' meeting on Friday. Even if the cartel ends up rolling over current cuts, prices may not be affected too much. According to some, traders have already priced in the roll-over."
Why The Worlds Largest Oil Company Wont Cut Dividends.html,"Despite a 44 percent drop in its 2020 profits, the Saudi Arabian government has instructed majority-state-owned Saudi Aramco to stick to the US$75 billion per year dividend payout for shareholders that it pledged at the time of the company’s initial public offering (IPO) in December 2019. Sticking to such a huge dividend payout – a guaranteed US$18.75 billion paid every quarter – has necessitated a significant cut in Aramco’s capital expenditure in the coming year that will damage the company’s prospects for growth and even the sustainability of its current operations. So why does the Saudi government not just reduce the dividend payable to Aramco’s shareholders instead? The basic answer to this often-asked question is that without such a massive payment being guaranteed virtually no one would have bought the shares in the first place and few would hold on to them now. This failure then or now would be highly dangerous for the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS). It should be remembered that MbS was only appointed as Crown Prince in June 2017, unprecedentedly taking over the role from Mohammed bin Nayef (MbN), a direct-line grandson from the founding father of the modern Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz. From that point, the jostling for succession after the current, frail King Salman dies between the two groups of supporters became even more energised. It was in this febrile atmosphere that MbS hit upon the idea of internationally listing Aramco as a symbol of the new Western-style, commercially-minded but socially-aware, savvy oil player that he wanted it to be seen as. Vital to this cornerstone strategy to ensure his succession as king – not to mention his very survival as Crown Prince – was that the Aramco IPO was seen as a palpable success and he himself set the metric for this appraisal: that the value of the intended 5 percent stake sold in Aramco should place a total value on the company of at least US$2 trillion. With an eye on bolstering his wider support amongst his own people as well, MbS made it clear that the new money coming in from the Aramco IPO would go into his ‘Vision 2030’ development plan that seeks to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy away from its reliance on oil and gas exports. Related Video: Nuclear fusion: The Unlimited Future
 The basic problem for him achieving his own targets was that the more that international investors came to know about Saudi Aramco’s operations, the less they wanted to take any part in it. This included all of the lies about its crude oil reserves claims, spare capacity claims, output claims, terms of its oil concessions claims, and independence from government influence claims, among other toxic elements for investors. This meant that by the time that the company was finally floated at the very end of 2019, it was not a 5% stake that MbS was able to sell but just 1.5% in the IPO window. It was also not at a value that would put a total value on Aramco of US$2 trillion but rather at a listing price per share of SAR32 (US$8.53), which implied a total value for Aramco of US$1.7 trillion. Worse still was that not a single major (or minor, for that matter) international stock exchange had wanted Aramco to list on it and that even in order to sell the 1.5% stake sold in the IPO, MbS’s team had to resort to tactics that did his reputation no good at all internationally. One of these was ‘encouraging’ the same senior Saudis who had been imprisoned and tortured in the Ritz-Carlton in 2017 (to force them to hand over hundreds of billions of riyals to the government for supposed corrupt payments that they had accepted in their business dealings, despite such payments – seen as ‘commissions’ - being a standard part of all business done in Saudi Arabia) to buy shares in the Aramco IPO. A similar-style tactic was also employed on those Middle East countries that wanted to avoid suffering the same fate as the blockade of Qatar by Saudi Arabia in 2017, which bought Aramco shares via their sovereign wealth funds and similar. Much of the remainder of the Aramco IPO was taken up by the investment vehicles of countries that sought to gain a geopolitical advantage such as China and Russia and by the investment banks working for Aramco and acting in the underwriting syndicates. Finally, Saudi nationals were promised the unprecedented deal of being able to take out new loans at a 2-to-1 ratio for every riyal that they would invest in Saudi Aramco, compared to an average leverage ratio limit for loans of 1-to-1. And it is precisely in light of this that MbS and his bankers knew that they had to offer an unheard-of massive guaranteed payment for years – in the form of the US$75 billion dividend paid every quarter – to all buyers of Aramco stock.  Related: Is Natural Gas Still A Safe Bet For Oil Majors? So, why was there so little common interest in Aramco shares? In the most basic terms, it is because Aramco’s future is highly uncertain. It could suffer a huge level of value destruction again if the Saudi lawmakers decide to launch another oil price war. The 2014-2016 Oil Price War launched by Saudi Arabia against the then still-nascent U.S. shale oil sector cost the OPEC member states collectively at least US$450 billion in revenues, according to the International Energy Agency, and caused Saudi Arabia to move from a budget surplus to a then-record high deficit in 2015 of US$98 billion and to spend at least US$250 billion of its precious foreign exchange reserves over that period that even senior Saudi officials said were lost forever.
 The 2014-2016 Oil Price War also irrevocably broke the Kingdom’s most important relationship in the world, established with the U.S. in 1945 in a deal signed by then-U.S.President Franklin Roosevelt and then-Saudi King Abdulaziz. The deal was, simply: the U.S. would receive all of the oil supplies it needed for as long as Saudi had oil in place, in return for which the U.S. would guarantee the security both of the ruling House of Saud and, by extension, Saudi Arabia. After the 2014-2016 Oil Price War, this effectively changed to: in return guaranteeing the security both of the ruling House of Saud and Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia will supply the U.S. with all of the oil it needs for as long as Saudi has oil in place and will allow the U.S. shale oil sector to prosper and to grow. After the 2020 Oil Price War broke this final pledge yet again, then-U.S. President Donald Trump directly told MbS during a telephone call on 2 April 2020 that unless OPEC started cutting oil production – that is, stopped the oil price war - he would be powerless to stop lawmakers from passing legislation to withdraw U.S. troops from the Kingdom. In addition, it was made very clear by Trump that he expected from then on that the next time that the Saudis tried to destroy the U.S. shale sector it would be the end of the 1945 Agreement, with no further warning, and that U.S. military would be withdrawn immediately. Even if new president Biden did not go through with his predecessor’s threats in the event that Saudi Arabia does start another oil price war, he can use the ‘No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Bill’ (NOPEC) threat that was taken to the line as well both by Trump and before that by George W. Bush. At the beginning of 2019, a committee from the U.S. House of Representatives approved the NOPEC bill that would have a broad mandate, making it illegal to artificially cap oil (and gas) production or to set prices, which is precisely what OPEC and Saudi Arabia attempt to do. It would also immediately remove the sovereign immunity that exists in U.S. courts for OPEC as a group and for its individual member states. This would leave Saudi Arabia open to being sued under existing U.S. anti-trust legislation, with its total liability being its estimated US$1 trillion of investments in the U.S. alone. The U.S. would then be legally entitled to freeze all Saudi bank accounts in the U.S., seize its assets in the country, halt all use of U.S. dollars by the Saudis anywhere in the world (oil, of course, is denominated in U.S. dollars), and to go after Aramco and its assets and funds, as it is still a majority state-owned production and trading vehicle. It would also mean that Aramco could be ordered to break itself up into smaller, constituent companies that are not deemed to break competition rules in the oil, gas, and petrochemicals sectors or to influence the oil price. Effectively, this would reduce the value of Aramco to zero."
Oil Markets Already Priced In An OPEC Output Cut Extension.html,"The closure of the Suez Canal led to a moderate price rally last week, which came after a significant decline in oil prices triggered by new and stringent lockdowns in Europe. The impact of the Suez Canal crisis on oil markets has been marginal due to a number of factors including (1) slowing demand especially in the EU, (2) relatively high inventory figures, and (3) the low volumes of crude oil passing through the canal (less than 5% of global supply).  Now the shipping channel has been unblocked again, the markets have priced in a short delay as more than 400 ships remain stuck, waiting to pass the waterway. The total amount of damage remains to be seen, but we expect oil tankers not to change their shipping routes as this is likely to increase costs and risks.  The incident, on the other hand, may lead to increased investment in the capacity expansion of the SUMED pipeline, which currently stands at around 2.5 million bpd, running from the Ain Sokhna terminal in the Suez Gulf to offshore Sidi Kerir in Alexandria on the Mediterranean Sea. OPEC+ is expected to extend current cuts through May OPEC+ is scheduled to hold a meeting this week to decide on its production policy in May. While multiple factors may impact the group's decision, the markets already priced in an expected rollover of current cuts through May. 
 Platts data for February 2021 concluded that current global oil demand stands at around 92 million bpd while global supply lingers around 91 million barrels per day, of which some 25.7 million barrels are produced by OPEC.  Related: Iran And China Strengthen Oil Ties With 25-Year Strategic Deal Given the uncertainty about the global demand recovery, OPEC+ is expected to continue to roll over its current cuts through May. Yet, if OPEC+ decides to roll over current cuts, the question remains whether Russia, and perhaps Kazakhstan will continue to be allowed to increase production to pre-agreed levels, given the expected rise in demand in May. Russia is set to increase its production by 125,000 bpd in April from 9.18 million bpd in February. The group is also expected to emphasize compliance levels especially for countries that failed to meet their output quota in recent months such as Iraq and Nigeria. OPEC compliance for March is expected to exceed 100% supported by the voluntary Saudi cuts. We expect Saudi Arabia to sustain its 1 million bpd voluntary cuts in May, which is likely to keep crude prices steady during this period of uncertainty about crude demand and a new wave of COVID infections. Based on that, CMarkits expects Brent prices to trade around $60-$63 in April, assuming the resumption of shipping through the Suez Canal and continued lockdown measures in Europe throughout April.
 US shale oil producers aren’t rushing to boost oil production despite the rise in WTI prices. Production only rose by some 100,000 bpd w/w to stand at 11 million bpd, while the number of oil increased to 324, from 309 rigs a month ago. Yet, sustained high prices could ultimately lead to a moderate rise of between 500,000 and 1 million bpd. Drillers may see themselves incentivized by not just higher crude prices, but also lower costs to service debt.  Related: Russia Aims To Raise Production, Backs OPEC+ Cut Rollover US oil stocks rebounding and diesel consumption falling US oil demand has slowed down somewhat last month, which is reflected by increasing crude inventory levels and declining diesel demand. Crude stocks have risen during the last 4 weeks, in part due to the lasting effects of the Texas Freeze. U.S. oil inventories stand at 502.7 million barrels, 46.4 million barrels above their level a year ago. These figures are expected to be a point on the agenda during the OPEC+ meeting, as they offset the group’s efforts in 2020 to bring inventories down to average levels. U.S. oil refineries are almost back to their processing levels prior to the cold blast, at 14.39 million bpd, yet they continue to process 1.45 million bpd below their pre-pandemic levels. Currently, demand for petroleum products stands at 18.70 million bpd, around 718,000 bpd below its level before the pandemic."
Iran And China Strengthen Oil Ties With 25 Year Strategic Deal.html,"China and Iran officially stated they would boost their energy and political cooperation as part of a 25-year strategic partnership agreement at a time when the U.S. is looking to sanction covert Iranian oil exports to China. This weekend, Iran and China signed the strategic partnership deal to expand relations in areas such as energy, infrastructure, industry, and technology, the office of the Iranian president said in a statement. The two countries also pledged to boost cooperation in fossil fuels and alternative energy, “security of demand and supply as well as transfer and transportation of fossil fuels and the Chinese side shall consider financing and investing in the up –and-downstream projects of the energy industries in Iran and the Iranian side shall provide the necessary facilitations and support in this respect,” Iran said.
 In recent weeks, various reports have suggested that China has been considerably boosting its crude oil imports from Iran—so much so that the ports in the Shandong province, where most independent refiners are based, are experiencing tanker traffic congestions. Increased buying from China has provided more incentive for Iranian oil exports. According to some estimates, China has been taking in some 856,000 bpd of Iranian crude this month—a 129-percent surge compared to February. China has never actually stopped buying crude oil from the Islamic Republic, even after the Trump Administration slapped sanctions on Iran’s oil sales in 2018, warning buyers to stay away from Iranian crude or risk being sanctioned and cut off from the U.S. banking system.
 The Biden Administration warned China earlier this month that it would not turn a blind eye to rising Iranian oil exports to Chinese ports, the Financial Times reported, citing a senior Biden administration official. According to the report, Washington has not missed the substantial increase in Iranian crude shipments to China. The U.S. has reminded Beijing that there are still sanctions in place against the Islamic Republic."
Russia Aims To Raise Production Backs OPEC Cut Rollover.html,"Russia, the leader of the non-OPEC group in OPEC+, favors a rollover of the alliance's oil production cuts while seeking a slight increase for itself to meet higher seasonal demand, a source with knowledge of Moscow's plans told Reuters on Monday. Russia has sought and obtained small increases for its oil production every month since the start of the year, while all other members of the OPEC+ pact—except for Kazakhstan—were set to keep their production flat after January. Saudi Arabia is also cutting an extra 1 million barrels per day (bpd) off its oil production on top of its quota for three months through April. OPEC+ hasn't significantly eased oil production since January when the collective output was increased by 500,000 bpd from 7.7 million bpd in December to 7.2 million bpd. Considering the still weak global demand, OPEC+ decided in January to give Russia and Kazakhstan small increases for February and March, keeping the overall production little changed. In each of those two months, Russia was set to ease its cuts by 75,000 bpd. For April, Russia was allowed to boost its production by 130,000 bpd, while the other members of the OPEC+ alliance are to keep their production flat next month.
 Saudi Arabia also extended its additional unilateral cut of 1 million bpd into April, compared to initial plans to have that cut in place only in February and March.  Related: Houthi Rebels Launch Missile Attack On Saudi Oil Terminal The OPEC+ panel reviewing production and the market situation is set to meet on March 31, while the ministers will gather for their monthly online meeting on April 1. Last week, four sources told Reuters that OPEC+ would likely decide to keep oil production essentially steady for another month. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have both spoken out in favor of the need to tread lightly when it comes to how much oil is put into the market.  
 Since the previous OPEC+ meeting in early March, oil prices have been on a rollercoaster journey, buoyed initially by expectations of a tighter market after the group didn't ease the cuts as expected. Later in March, fears of weak demand dragged Brent prices down from $70 to $60 as major European economies reinstated or extended lockdowns and as more than a dozen EU countries suspended vaccinations with the AstraZeneca vaccine for weeks due to concerns over side effects until the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said—again—that the vaccine was safe.  "
UAE Launches Own Oil Futures Contract.html,"The UAE potentially made history today when it sounded the starting pistol for its Murban crude oil futures, to be traded on the brand new ICE Futures Abu Dhabi exchange. The price for what the UAE hopes to become a regional benchmark stood at $63.93 a little after midnight GMT, Reuters reports, adding that 2,132 lots of 1,000 barrels each were traded by that time, according to an ICE tweet.
 The launch of the Murban futures is part of the UAE’s attempt to revolutionize trade in Middle Eastern oil. Per a Bloomberg report, the introduction of the futures removes the restraints that until now kept the spot market for oil closed off for large Middle Eastern producers, who either sold their crude directly to refiners or to the foreign companies operating their fields. This, Bloomberg noted, prevented buyers from reselling the oil or profiting from arbitrage deals. “If successful -- and I think the chances are good -- Murban futures could be a pivotal moment for Middle East crude pricing,” according to Vandana Hari, founder of Singapore-based Vanda Insights. If “a sizable chunk of Middle Eastern crude trades freely in the spot market,” other Middle Eastern producers may follow suit with their own futures.
 There are two benchmark contracts in the Middle East right now: the Dubai benchmark, operated by S&P Platts, and the DME (Dubai Mercantile Exchange) Oman. The Murban contract is tied to the most popular crude oil grade produced by Abu Dhabi’s ADNOC. Physical delivery of the oil bought under this contract will be made at the port of Fujairah in the UAE. To ensure enough physical supply for deliveries, ADNOC has invested $900 million in building 40 million barrels worth of storage space near the port city. ADNOC produces around 2 million barrels of Murban daily."
Worlds Largest Oil Companies Saw Revenues Slide 354 In 2020.html,"The biggest oil companies in the world, including Big Oil, Saudi Aramco, Russia's top oil producers, and the top oilfield services providers, saw their combined revenues fall by 35.4 percent to US$1.3 trillion in 2020 from US$2.02 trillion in 2019, data compiled by Anadolu Agency shows. The agency analyzed the financial statements of the 14 biggest firms— ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Halliburton, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, Shell, BP, Total, Eni, Equinor, Lukoil, Rosneft, and Saudi Aramco. Shell's revenues dropped the most—by 48 percent—while BP, Aramco, and Exxon all saw their respective revenues fall by more than 30 percent in 2020 compared to 2019, according to the data pulled by the Anadolu Agency.
 The oil price and demand collapse last year hit all oil companies' revenues and earnings, as both the upstream and downstream divisions suffered from the pandemic-driven crisis. Some posted historic losses as they also wrote down the value of their resources. ExxonMobil, for example, booked its first annual loss since the 1999 merger of Exxon and Mobil, and the first annual loss in at least 40 years after the pandemic crushed oil demand and prices and led to a huge domestic gas asset impairment. BP also posted a massive loss of US$5.7 billion in 2020, compared to a US$10-billion profit in 2019.
 Total reported a net loss of US$7.2 billion for 2020, down from a profit of US$11.27 billion for 2019, and said it will change its name to TotalEnergies to reflect its shift to renewable energy. Shell managed to turn a profit last year, but it was down by a massive 87 percent compared to 2019. Saudi Aramco's net profit slumped by 44 percent year over year to US$49 billion for 2020, but it kept its US$75 billion annual dividend, most of which goes to the biggest oil firm's majority owner with 98 percent, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."
The UK Prepares To Boost North Sea Drilling.html,"The U.K. has announced a ‘Landmark Deal’ to drill new wells in the North Sea securing the future of U.K. oil and saving thousands of jobs while calling net-zero promises into question. The U.K. government has approved new licenses for the drilling of more wells in the North Sea, saying their aim is compatible with the transition away from fossil fuels. The deal strives to better safeguard the British economy as well as oil industry jobs.  This comes just weeks after the Financial Times stated that in 2020 oil and gas company spending in the U.K. North Sea fell to its lowest level since 2004, spending around £3.4 billion ($4.6 billion) less than in 2019. Drilling activity also fell to levels not experienced since the 1970s.  While environmentalists have criticized the move, the government insists that ‘Climate Compatibility Checkpoints’ will measure the national demand for oil and gas, projected production levels, the development of alternative energy technologies, as well as the sector’s progress in cutting emissions to help ensure green policy targets are met.  Current targets for the sector include reducing emissions by 10 percent by 2025 and 25 percent by 2027, ultimately requiring oil companies to reduce their emissions by 50 percent by 2030. A public-private investment of £16 billion ($21.8 billion) is expected to achieve this goal, principally going towards hydrogen production and carbon capture technologies.  This week’s announcement goes against earlier speculation that the U.K. might follow in the footsteps of Norway and Denmark, which have banned new oil exploration licenses, to curb its North Sea production in favor of net-zero objectives and greener policies.  
 The U.K. government has been accused of sending mixed messages by first announcing its net-zero aims followed by promises to secure the position of the country’s oil and gas sector well into the future.   Related: World’s Newest Oil Hotspot Undeterred By Poor Drilling Results Furthermore, many believe new plans for the oil industry are at odds with a government promise for its leadership role in the critical COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.   However, those in the oil and gas sector praise the government’s decision which is expected to save 40,000 jobs. It will also provide the industry with the time needed to make the transition to a clean energy future by helping companies to decarbonize, according to the U.K. government.  During this period, the government hopes to create the right business environment to attract new industrial sectors to base themselves in the UK, develop new export opportunities for British business, and secure new high-value jobs for the long-term.
 Business and energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng has stated, the North Sea deal sends “a clear message around the world” that the UK will be “a nation of clean energy”. In addition, the UK will “not leave oil and gas workers behind” in the “irreversible shift away from fossil fuels”. This suggests that the U.K. is taking a step away from major E.U. powers in their pledge to reduce oil production in favor of alternative energy sources over the next decade, instead opting to make oil production ‘cleaner’.  In contrast to this announcement, the government has also vowed that from 31st March 2021 it will no longer provide support for the fossil fuel energy sector overseas. This is in line with Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s commitment to end taxpayer support for fossil fuels projects overseas. Only time will tell whether the government’s promise for a clean energy transition developed hand-in-hand with the oil and gas industry will put the U.K. on track to meet its net-zero carbon aims over the next decade.  "
China Overtakes US As Worlds Largest Refiner.html,"As the shift in oil demand from Covid-19 turned the tables of regional levels of fuel production and exports, China succeeded in overtaking the USA as the world’s biggest oil refiner in 2020.  As China began to ramp up its refining capacity throughout the pandemic, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) published data showing that China processed more crude oil than the U.S. for much of 2020.   While the USA suffered from a drop in demand throughout 2020, leading to a decrease in all oil-related activities, China benefited from this international shift. In contrast to the U.S., when oil prices fall, the Chinese government pays refiners to increase production levels. China currently has at least four major new refineries under construction, most of which are expected to produce plastic feedstocks, such as ethylene and propylene. While the U.S. is likely to once again overtake China as the world’s biggest oil refiner by the end of 2021, long-term demand predictions mean it's probable that this trend will be short-lived, as oil needs across Asia continue to rise.   Oil refineries across the U.S. have been losing momentum in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. At the end of last year, Royal Dutch Shell Plc ground production at its Convent refinery in Louisiana to a halt. This same facility had 35 times the refining capacity of China when it opened in 1967, showing how dramatically the tables have turned over the past couple of decades. 
 Oil refineries have also been impeded this year by the severe storm that hit the state of Texas in February. During the storm, oil refining fell to its lowest levels since 2008. This was largely due to frozen pipelines which forced producers to halt activities. Refinery crude runs fell by 2.6 million bpd throughout the week to 12.2 million bpd.  Related: How Will We Pay for the Energy Transition? Meanwhile, in November, China was processing around 1.2 million bpd of crude oil. Much of this new refining work was taking place in the new unit at Rongsheng Petrochemical’s giant Zhejiang facility in northeast China. China is not the only Asian giant to invest in refining over the next decade. Just a few weeks ago, India announced plan to invest $4.5 billion in a Panipat refinery expansion by September 2024. This would increase Panipat’s capacity by two-thirds to 500,000 bpd.  Only slightly behind China, as the world’s third largest oil importer and consumer, India is striving to increase its oil refining capacity by 60 percent to meet the country’s increasing oil demand. This comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to improve India’s manufacturing sector. 
 The refinery expansion is expected to boost India’s production of petrochemicals and value-added specialty products, such as petrol, diesel, and ATF. State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has also announced plans to build a new refinery at Nagapattinam in the southern state of Tamil Nadu at a cost of $4.01 billion. The IOC subsidiary Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited is expected to develop the refinery. The project is aimed at meeting the demand of petroleum products across southern India. While U.S. refining activities are expected to pick up before the end of the year, a dramatically increased oil refining capacity in China, as well as new projects in India, suggest that the face of the industry could change over the next decade. As oil demand wanes in the U.S. and continues to increase across Asia, many Asian countries will be seeking out refined products from closer to home to meet their needs."
OPEC Will Keep A Lid On Oil Production.html,"OPEC+ will likely decide to keep oil production essentially steady for another month, according to four Reuters sources. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have both spoke out in favor of the need to tread lightly when it comes to how much oil is put into the market. And this week is perhaps proof positive that the group would be wise to heed. On Tuesday this week, the price of Brent crude plunged to $60.86 per barrel from $69.63 per barrel on March 11. By Wednesday, the price had rebounded to nearly $64 per barrel—up more than 5% on the day.
 The dramatic price fluctuations are attributable to a variety of events, including U.S. oil inventory figures, another round of lockdowns in the EU, AstraZeneca vaccine safety and efficacy concerns, and a vessel stuck in the Suez canal causing a traffic jam of oil tankers. No matter the reason for the price swings, the data suggests that the market is still sensitive to stimuli—bullish or bearish, and nothing but a sustained increase in demand is likely to cure that. Even if OPEC holds production steady for April—or allows a couple of eager producers to ramp up just slightly—there remain a couple of wildcards that threaten OPEC’s ability to keep supplies tight: Libya and Iran.
 Libya, complete with its unified government and exempt from OPEC’s production cut agreement, has plans—and now perhaps the ability—to increase its oil production. Libya’s ambitions are to lift its oil production to 1.45 million bpd by the end of the year from 1.3 million bpd now. Iran and Venezuela are also exempt from the production cuts. Iran’s oil exports have been on the rise, and Venezuela’s production has been rising, even if only slightly."
Pandemic Puts Saudi Kuwaiti Oil Plans On Ice.html,"The market shock from the pandemic and the resulting crash in oil prices expectedly dragged down the net profit of the world’s biggest oil company and largest oil exporter, Saudi Aramco.   The 2020 year of COVID also upended the development plans of the Saudi state oil giant at the oilfields it co-owns with other countries in the Gulf. In early 2020, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were preparing to significantly boost oil production in the so-called neutral zone between the two countries after ending a five-year spat over concessions. Both sides had grand plans to pump as much as 550,000 barrels per day (bpd)—or 0.5 percent of daily global oil supply—from the jointly owned fields by the end of 2020. The unexpected events last year, however, led to the fields producing just around 120,000 bpd, which for Saudi Aramco means up to 60,000 bpd as output is equally divided between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Aramco’s president and chief executive officer Amin Nasser said on the call after the 2020 results release. Not only did the pandemic slash Aramco’s profits in 2020, but it also put on ice its plans to quickly ramp up production from the fields it shares with Kuwait in the neutral zone.   Related: 13 Million Barrels Of Oil Could Be Affected By Suez Canal Blockage
 The so-called Partitioned Neutral Zone (PNZ) was established between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in 1922 to settle a territorial dispute between the two neighboring countries. As of 2015, the oil production capacity in the neutral zone stood at a total of 600,000 bpd, equally divided between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Production from the zone averaged around 500,000 bpd just before the shutdown of the two oil fields, Al-Khafji and Wafra, in 2014-2015. Operational differences and a worsening in bilateral relations led to the suspension of production back in 2015. The worsening came as Saudi Arabia renewed Chevron’s concession for Wafra. According to the Kuwaiti side, Riyadh did that without consulting it. One of the upstream milestones Aramco boasted in its 2020 presentation was resumed operations at the Al-Khafji oilfield. Just after the owner of Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia, broke the OPEC+ pact with Russia in March last year, contributing to the oil price crash in the demand collapse, Abdullah Mansi Al-Shammari, Deputy CEO Finance and Management at Kuwait Gulf Oil Company, told Reuters that total production from the two oilfields, Al-Khafji and Wafra, would hit 320,000 bpd by the end of 2020. During the Saudi-Russia price war in March and early April 2020, Kuwait even exported its first cargo of Khafji crude oil, after the nearly five-year hiatus—during which the fields were not pumping oil.
 But after the new OPEC+ deal entered into force in May 2020 to prevent another price collapse and help the market to rebalance in the face of plunging fuel demand, the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, and all OPEC+ members had to scale back oil production much more than they would have done had they kept the initial agreement. The restart of production at the Al-Khafji oilfield last year marked the end of a five-year hiatus due to disputes. Still, the much lower-than-expected output from the neutral zone highlighted the challenges in ramping up production from oilfields that haven’t pumped oil in years, and operational decisions on major oilfields in the Middle East depend largely on OPEC’s policies, which is effectively led by Saudi Arabia. The future OPEC+ policies on withholding oil supply from the market will determine whether the Al-Khafji and Wafra fields shared with Kuwait could return to pumping meaningful volumes of crude soon. As of February, OPEC’s spare capacity, excluding Iran, stood at 7.7 million bpd, mostly in the Middle East, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its monthly report earlier in March, when it said that with “plenty to spare” capacity and still abundant supply, there is no supercycle for oil around the corner.  "
Canadian Oil Lobby Declares War On Netflix.html,"If you are the parent of a school-aged child, particularly during these online learning environment times, you’ve probably heard your fair share about the evils of fossil fuels and the savior that is renewables. Hollywood is also disseminating anti-oil material aimed at young children--or in this particular case, Netflix--drawing the ire of the oil lobby, which is gearing up for war. Educators with limited energy knowledge--often social studies educators--are quick to point out the myriad problems with fossil fuels. They are less quick to point out the problems with renewables, which just so happen to be real. Hollywood, too, is now picking up the mantle against fossil fuels, and they are even less subtle.  Case in point, Netflix’s movie The Big Foot Family, which has the oil industry up in arms. One Canadian lobbyist group, Candian Energy Centre, has accused the film of “brainwashing” youngsters and peddling lies.  Those are harsh words for a cartoon that struggles to squeeze in complex topics into an animated adventure that aims to entertain youngsters. The movie’s main character is green-crusader Big Foot, who travels to the Alaskan wilderness to protest against an oil company known as X-TRACT Oil. X-TRACT is touting its clean method of extracting oil that doesn’t leave any environmental footprint. The oil company is lying, of course, and instead of sustainable drilling for an unsustainable resource, X-TRACT plans to detonate a bomb to spill oil over the pristine Alaskan wilderness.   Related: Oil Slips On Small Crude Inventory Build While Canada might be offended by the insinuation that oil is inherently evil, BP has been silent, even though the X-TRACT oil depicted in the movie looks suspiciously similar to BP: bright, shiny, BP-green, and complete with BP’s new greenspeak. Nevertheless, BP likely views this Netflix challenger as beneath it or as an unworthy adversary.  BP should not be so quick to dismiss. After all, according to Whitney Houston, and conveniently also according to Canadian Energy Centre, these children are our future.
 And given the politicization of fossil fuels, these kids will either be for or against fossil fuels.  “Our children are the key to the future,” the Canada oil lobby group said, adding that those kids “can’t succeed if they’re filled with misinformation.”  And make no mistake, this film took great pains to explain not just how evil the oil company and its workers were, but how proud the parents were of their children’s anti-oil company activism which included breaking into the oil company grounds to save the town from utter destruction. The Canadian oil lobby group was created just a few years ago and dubbed the “energy war room” as it started to become clear that fossil fuels were in the crosshairs of advocacy groups, activist investors, Hollywood, and the media. It is, after all, the main revenue source for the oil-rich province of Alberta.  They were ready for war then, and they are certainly ready for it now.  “For too long, the reputation of Alberta’s energy sector has been damaged by a deceitful campaign to landlock the oilsands. The Canadian Energy Centre will focus on improving perceptions about the oil and gas industry,” Alberta’s Minister of Energy Sonya Savage said in October 2019, a few months after the group was formed. Its strategy? To apply a “fact-based approach to counteracting the misinformation about our industry.” This is the same group that has accused foreign actors of financing anti-oil coverage in the media and started a million-dollar investigation to get to the bottom of it. 
 According to the group’s website, energy is the largest subsector of Canada’s economy, accounting for $221 billion of nominal GDP in 2018.  Related: Report Accuses Banks Of Creating “Climate Chaos” As the Canadian Energy Centre suggests, the movie does villainize energy workers. But what it also does is lash out at green energy initiatives that energy companies are taking--at great expense. Big Oil has been repeatedly kicked for doing what the green crusaders have been asking them to do for decades--one can only wonder if any change will truly satisfy climate activists--even ones that are legitimate and not greenwashing. Minister Savage has spoken out in defense of the Canadian Energy Centre over its Big Foot Family comments. Savage said that while she doesn’t always agree with the Centre’s tactics, the government of Canada needs to fight back against misinformation about the oil and gas industry. Of course, all this attention that is being paid to the Big Foot Family after the CEC’s efforts may have sparked a viewing frenzy on Netflix, as everyone rushed to find out what all the fuss was about. The movie soon landed itself on Netflix’s Top 10 list.  One could view this as proof that CEC’s media campaign is influential as intended, or that Big Foot Family won the day by grabbing more viewers than its dubious quality would otherwise warrant. Either way, the war between the fossil fuel and anti-fossil fuel camps is heating up with the divide growing larger by the day. But even as the climate crowd struggles to change the narrative surrounding energy, the world’s largest oil and gas producers, including Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Qatar, are forging ahead with new fossil fuel projects. But oil and gas companies should remain vigilant if they hope to survive in this new climate."
Oil Slips On Small Crude Inventory Build.html,"U.S. crude oil inventories went up by 1.9 million barrels in the week to March 19, the Energy Information reported, adding that at 502.7 million barrels, inventories were 6 percent above the five-year average for this time of year. The figure compares with a build of 13.8 million barrels reported for the previous week. Analysts had expected the EIA to report an inventory decline of some 900,000 barrels. A day earlier, the American Petroleum Institute reported a crude oil inventory build of 2.927 million barrels for last week.
 In gasoline, the EIA reported an inventory build of 200,000 barrels for the week to March 19. This compared with another modest 500,000-barrel increase in gasoline inventories a week earlier. Production averaged 8.6 million bpd last week, compared with 8.9 million bpd a week earlier. In middle distillates, the EIA estimated an inventory increase of 3.8 million barrels for the third week of March. This compared with a build of 300,000 barrels for the previous week. Production stood at 4.6 million bpd, versus 4.2 million bpd a week earlier. Oil prices have been on the decline, too, this week, as Europe battles yet another rise in Covid-19 infections and several EU states have started tightening movement restrictions soon after they relaxed them in anticipation of a steady decline in infections, which failed to materialize.
 Prices got a boost earlier today, however, on the news that one of the largest container ships in the world ran aground in the narrowest point of the Suez Canal, effectively blocking it for what could be days. There is also a certain element of price correction, according to observers, after Brent hit $70 per barrel earlier this month, prompting profit-taking behavior. That came on top of growing concern about demand recovery, with Bloomberg noting the rising number of unsold Western African oil cargos scheduled to load in April. At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $62.74 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at $59.68 a barrel. Both benchmarks were slightly up from the close of trade on Tuesday but nowhere near enough to recoup the losses they suffered over the past week."
The US Imports Record Share Of Russian Oil Despite Tensions.html,"U.S. refiners have turned to Russian oil and petroleum products to fill the gap that sanctioned Venezuelan crude and drastically reduced OPEC shipments have left in U.S. imports, despite the energy standoff between the United States and Russia. In 2020, the U.S. imported more oil and refined products from Russian than from Saudi Arabia, with Russia’s share of American oil exports at a record-high 7 percent, Bloomberg News has estimated based on customs and EIA data.   Russia mostly displaced the market previously held by Venezuela—now unable to sell its heavy oil to U.S. refiners because of the American sanctions on Nicolas Maduro’s regime. U.S. oil imports from Russia exceeded last year even the imports from OPEC’s top producer and de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, which—after briefly flooding the U.S. market with its crude in April 2020—drastically cut shipments to the most transparent market to help inventory drawdowns amid collapsing fuel demand globally.
 As per Bloomberg calculations, the United States imported on average 538,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil and oil products from Russia last year. This was higher than the average American imports of oil from Saudi Arabia, which is estimated to have shipped on average 522,000 bpd to the United States. Russia thus became the third-biggest oil supplier to America in 2020, according to Bloomberg’s estimates. In 2019, the top five sources of U.S. total petroleum, including crude oil, imports were: Canada, with 49 percent share of imports, Mexico with 7 percent, Saudi Arabia with 6 percent, Russia also with 6 percent, and Colombia with a 4-percent share.  Related: Kazakhstan Is Eager To Abandon The OPEC+ Deal Valero and ExxonMobil were the biggest buyers of Russian oil and oil products last year, according to customs data cited by Bloomberg.
 Most of the oil that U.S. refiners buy from Russia is not crude oil, but fuel oil they use to produce gasoline in the absence of Venezuelan heavy oil supply to complement the imports of heavy Canadian crude from the oil sands. Energy consultants and analysts told Bloomberg that they haven’t seen any concern in the White House about the rising imports of oil from Russia, while the new U.S. Administration continues to threaten sanctions on partners of the Russia-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project in Europe."
