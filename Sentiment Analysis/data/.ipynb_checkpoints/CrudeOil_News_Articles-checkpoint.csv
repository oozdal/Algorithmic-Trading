Asias Physical Oil Market Strengthens In Sign Of Rising Demand.html,"China and Japan have recently intensified purchases of crude oil on the spot market, driving spot premiums for some grades to their highest in several months and signaling that Asia’s physical demand for crude is rising despite the crisis in India, where fuel consumption is slumping. The premiums for cargoes of some of Asia’s favorite grades such as ESPO of Russia and Al-Shaheen of Qatar have jumped in recent days to their highest in months, traders told Bloomberg on Wednesday. Rising premiums, as well as deepening backwardation of the Dubai futures structure, are pointing to continued recovery in oil demand in the most important oil-importing region. Backwardation is the state of the market signaling tighter supplies with prompt prices higher than those further out in time.
 The bullish signals of demand from China and Japan add to the signs that Europe’s demand has also started to recover as most of the largest economies are re-opening. In the UK, for example, fuel sales surged earlier this month to their highest level since the first lockdown in March last year, according to government data cited by Bloomberg. In Asia, India’s demand has unsurprisingly dropped in the past weeks, with gasoline sales estimated down to a one-year low and diesel consumption dropping to the lowest in seven months in the first two weeks of May.
 But refiners in China and Japan have been raising crude oil purchases from the Middle East and Russia. According to Bloomberg, Rongsheng Petrochemical Co of China bought as much as 12 million barrels of oil from Middle Eastern producers Iraq, Oman, and Abu Dhabi. This was the biggest purchase in seven months. Japan’s refiners, for their part, have bought at least five oil cargoes of the Al-Shaheen grade from Qatar at the biggest premium this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg."
The IEA May Have Given OPEC A Huge Gift.html,"An immediate halt to oil exploration is one of the steps that need to be taken in order for the world to reach Paris Agreement climate change commitments. That’s what the International Energy Agency said in a first-of-its-kind roadmap to net zero. The roadmap features a lot of fascinating changes that our species would need to make to their way of life by 2050, and most of them are already popular enough with various forecasters: a massive increase in electric car sales is there and an equally massive shift to wind and solar power as sources of electricity. Yet an immediate stop of new oil exploration has so far not been on the agenda of anyone but environmentalist groups on the radical end of the activism spectrum. With its call for the end of all new oil exploration, however, the IEA may have given OPEC a huge gift. “Beyond projects already committed as of 2021, there are no new oil and gas fields approved for development in our pathway, and no new coal mines or mine extensions are required,” the authority said in its report. The prediction is global, but of course, there is no way the IEA or any other single agency could force countries to stop boosting their oil production until demand for it subsides. This is exactly what the Gulf members of OPEC and Russia are doing. They are building their oil production capacity in a bid to monetize their natural resource assets while there is still demand for them. But here’s the twist: roadmaps are not factual information. They are general projections at best, and wishful thinking with figures thrown in at worst. 
 “The contraction of oil and natural gas production will have far-reaching implications for all the countries and companies that produce these fuels,” the IEA said in its roadmap, adding, notably, “For oil, the OPEC share of a much-reduced global oil supply increases from around 37% in recent years to 52% in 2050, a level higher than at any point in the history of oil markets.” Indeed, the authority clarifies that this concentration of oil supply will be a lot less significant than the concentration of global oil supply that is in OPEC’s hands today when the whole world is running on oil. According to the roadmap, by 2050, oil demand will be a fraction of what it is today, so nobody would care about whether OPEC controls 30 or 50 percent of the global supply. The problem is that while the more benevolent parts of the roadmap are arguably quite hypothetical, the increase in OPEC’s control of global oil reserves is quite a realistic scenario. The call for a suspension of new oil exploration would resonate with the new cohort of ESG investors who have been pressuring Big Oil—the world’s largest non-state producers of oil—into effectively moving away from their core business. It’s far-fetched to say that activist investors would be able to pressure Big Oil into suspending all new exploration activities by the end of this year, but it is not unthinkable that it could happen in a few years or a decade.  Related: The IEA’s Latest Proposal Is Both Reckless And Impossible In contrast, OPEC producers are state-owned entities. There are no activist investors who could pressure Rosneft—despite BP’s stake in it—or Adnoc or even Saudi Aramco into stopping their production capacity-building efforts. OPEC countries are not members of the European Union and cannot be forced to comply with EU’s net-zero goals. They’re also not members of the OECD. Last month, a former leader of the British Conservatives, William Hague, suggested in an article that UK military forces and diplomacy might be deployed across the world to protect the environment: “In the past, the UK has been willing to use all of our firepower, both military and diplomatic, to secure and extract fossil fuels. But in the future, the UK will need to use all of its diplomatic capacity to ensure that these resources are not used and that natural environments are protected.” Yet this is more of an eccentric idea than the basis for another roadmap, at least at this point in time. It appears that net-zero ambitions are growing exponentially, and it is not unthinkable that we will—in the fullness of time—see a roadmap to protecting the world’s remaining fossil fuel resources. One might even go so far as suggesting that the wars of the future will be wars for keeping oil in the ground rather than wars over extracting.
 But on a more realistic note, while it is perfectly plausible that Big Oil could be pressured into shrinking its oil and gas output by governments and shareholders, the state-owned oil companies of OPEC members are free to continue their exploration efforts. It’s worth noting here that these exploration efforts have historically been led by Big Oil because of its technical expertise and financial means. This is not to say, however, the Big Oil club is the only one with technical expertise and financial means. Money tends to buy expertise, and a shrinking oil supply base will boost oil prices significantly while the West advances its net-zero agenda. The expectation that oil demand in 2050 will be 75 percent lower than it is today and average 25 million bpd would prompt some who are committed to a cleaner-air future to cheer. However, that would require that every other expectation of the IEA as laid out in its roadmap is met, too, and this is a little difficult to believe. These feature universal energy access by 2030 when there are close to a billion people without such access to date and no major plans to change this for several reasons. The roadmap also sees a global end to sales of internal combustion engine cars by 2035—a move that would practically require governments to force their citizens to switch to EVs, which would raise some questions about rights and freedoms in a democracy. The list of hypothetical expectations by the IEA is as long as its report. The most realistic among them remains the expectation that OPEC will come to account for even more of the world’s oil supply than it does now. What the cartel can do now is keep its fingers crossed that OECD countries stay on their net-zero path. The rest of the world is big enough to keep OPEC in the petrodollar game for decades to come."
Oil Prices Tumble As Crude Inventories Rise.html,"Crude oil prices moved further down today after the Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory build of 1.3 million barrels for the week to May 14. This compared with an estimated oil inventory build of a modest 620,000 barrels for the period, as reported by the American Petroleum Institute. It also compared with a draw of 400,000 barrels, as estimated by the Energy Information Administration a week earlier. Analysts had expected an inventory build of 1.68 million barrels for the week to May 14. In gasoline, the EIA reported an inventory decline of 2 million barrels for last week, which compared with a build of 400,000 barrels a week earlier. Gasoline production last week averaged 9.8 million bpd, which compared with 9.6 million bpd a week earlier.
 In middle distillates, the authority estimated an inventory draw of 2.3 million barrels for last week. This compared with a stock decline of 1.7 million barrels for the previous week. Middle distillate production averaged 4.6 million bpd last week, compared with 4.7 million bpd a week earlier. Refineries operated at 86.3 percent of capacity last week, processing an average 15.1 million bpd of crude. This compared with 15 million bpd for the previous week. This week, some refineries on the Gulf Coast have been experiencing weather-related trouble that has affected their processing rates. How severe the effect will be should become known in EIA’s next weekly petroleum status report. 
 Heavy rains and flooding are already pounding East Texas and Louisiana ahead of what forecasters from the Colorado State University expect will be a hurricane season with ‘above average” activity. Crude oil prices plunged yesterday on news that the U.S.-Iranian talks on the nuclear deal were progressing, with Russia’s envoy Mikhail Ulyanov telling the BBC that ""important news is likely to be released by tomorrow"" and ""the negotiations have made major progress"". Later, Ulyanov clarified his statement, noting that it was too early for a breakthrough. This did not have a major effect on prices, which, at the time of writing, were at $66.04 per barrel for Brent crude and $62.69 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate."
Heavy Rains Reduce Gulf Coast Refinery Output.html,"Four refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast have reduced their processing rates because of heavy rains and flooding in East Texas and Louisiana. The severe weather conditions are forecast to continue this week, Reuters reports. Among the refineries that suffered slowdowns was Total’s Port Arthur facility, which has a daily processing capacity of 225,500 barrels of crude oil and which suffered a brief power outage at the start of this week. Another was Motiva’s 630,000-bpd refinery in Port Arthur, which was hit by a transformer blowout on Monday, Reuters noted. A unit of Valero Energy’s Port Arthur processing facility suffered an outage, too, at the beginning of this week, according to data from Genscape that Reuters cited. The refinery has a capacity of 335,000 barrels of crude daily.
 The fourth refinery that is partially shutting down is Exxon’s Baton Rouge facility in Louisiana, but, according to unnamed Reuters sources, the shutdown is for planned maintenance of a distillation unit and has nothing to do with the weather. The heavy rains and flooding come ahead of hurricane season in June, with forecasts pointing towards “above average” storm activity this year. Colorado State University said in its annual forecast that it expected 17 named storms this season—eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes.  That compares to an average of 12.1 named storms per season between 1981 and 2010, and 6.4 named hurricanes per season, of which 2.7 major ones.
 “We anticipate an above-average probability for major hurricanes making landfall along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean,” CSU forecasters said. Gulf Coast refineries were in February battered by the cold spell that rose to notoriety as the Texas Freeze, which took out power plants, oilfields, and refineries as equipment froze and power outages spread far and wide."
The IEAs Latest Proposal Is Both Reckless And Impossible.html,"The International Energy Agency,  which has stepped up its efforts to become a major green energy supporter, appears to have forgotten the reason it was set up as an agency in the first place. In its new report “Net Zero in 2050”, the energy agency calls for no new investments in oil- and gas-related projects.   As stated by Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, “new energy security challenges will emerge on the way to net zero by 2050 while longstanding ones will remain, even as the role of oil and gas diminishes”.  The IEA also stated that the contraction of oil and natural gas production will have far-reaching implications for all the countries and companies that produce these fuels. In a very remarkable statement, Birol said that “no new oil and natural gas fields are needed in the net zero pathway”. While he admits that, within that pathway, oil and gas supplies (aka production) will become increasingly concentrated in a small number of low-cost producers. Based on its own assessments, the IEA predicts that OPEC’s share of a much-reduced global oil supply will increase from 37% at present to 52% in 2050, a level higher than at any point in the history of oil markets. While the IEA’s new report focuses on the need to drastically reduce our use of fossil fuels in order to reduce CO2 and methane emission, there are some major underlying issues it fails to address. In its determination to reach Net Zero emissions by 2050, the IEA appears to have engaged in wishful thinking, ignoring the existing constraints and immense investments needed to achieve such a goal. In its report, the agency does admit that there are severe risks on the way to Net Zero, including geopolitical and economic risks related to an overdependency on critical minerals. 
 The fact that the main risks are not only geopolitical but also commercial appears to have been ignored. At present, demand for critical materials and minerals is already putting immense pressure on markets, suppliers, and overall costs. If you extrapolate this demand growth under the IEA’s net zero pathway, markets will not be able to keep up with supply, and risk levels will increase exponentially.   The main criticism that should be leveled at this new report is its statement that no new investments are needed in upstream oil and gas worldwide. That statement not only runs entirely contrary to the main reason that the IEA was founded, namely to promote secure and affordable energy supplies to foster economic growth, but it also seems to forget the pivotal role hydrocarbons, mainly oil and gas, play in the global economy. By understanding oil and gas as simply energy products, the IEA appears to overlook the downstream products that are produced by the same sector.  By shaping an environment in which the call to divest or not invest in oil and gas is central, several key markets including chemicals, semi-products, and fertilizers, are going to suffer. Another factor to consider is the pivotal role that international oil majors (IOCs) and independents play in the global market. To focus all efforts on removing one part of the global market is to threaten the stability of both energy and economic security. For decades the symbiosis between IOCs and NOCs has been a key pillar of stability in energy security, as both have different strategies and production approaches. By removing available financing for IOCs via divestment, the market power will be given to the national oil companies or government-led entities, which will also give them significant influence in global markets. 
  Related: Oman Plans Massive $30 Billion Green Hydrogen Project Currently, most oil and gas reserves are in the hands of national governments, which can be demonstrated by the power of OPEC+. International oil companies currently have the right (concession) to produce and explore for oil/gas within these. At the same time, most production reserves (P1/+P3) of IOCs are already at critical levels, with most IOCs holding reserves for 5-6 years of full production. By removing access to capital or even their license to operate, IOCs will not be able to survive in their current business models. That may be seen by some as a desirable outcome, but economically and geopolitically it could be a disaster. Without independents, all power will fall into the hands of national producers.  Some already consider OPEC+ to be a cartel, and if you remove IOCs from the equation, it truly would have the power of one. A fully renewable, sustainable, and stable world before 2050 is not something that can be achieved without oil and gas for both petrochemicals and energy. The IEA’s member countries may be able to cough up the cost of this aggressive green strategy without imploding their own economic wealth, but non-OECD countries will not be able or willing to. Oil and gas will be needed for economic growth, transport, and mobility. In short, the approach suggested by the IEA is not only impossible but also reckless."
Colombias Oil Industry Is On The Brink Of Collapse.html,"Colombia’s oil industry is yet again under considerable pressure, despite the national government in Bogota attempting to reactivate the economically crucial sector. The March 2020 oil price crash, COVID-19 pandemic, rising security risk and now significant political turmoil are weighing heavily on the oil industry’s performance. After a rough 2020 where Colombia’s five-month long quarantine lockdown sharply impacted operational activity and crude oil production, there are signs that the Andean country’s oil industry is struggling to recover. This comes after a moment of optimism in late-2020 where it appeared that Colombia’s hydrocarbon sector was on track to return to a pre-pandemic tempo of operations. The latest data from the energy ministry for Latin America’s fourth largest economy indicates that is not the case. During March 2020, Colombia pumped a daily average of 744,715 barrels of crude oil and 1.2 million cubic feet of natural gas, which is a 0.14% and 5% less than a month earlier.  Source: Colombia Ministry of Mines and Energy, U.S. EIA. More worrying are signs that Colombia’s hydrocarbon sector is struggling to recover from a devastating 2020. A reliable de-facto indicator of industry activity is the Baker Hughes rig count. The latest data shows that by the end of April 2021 there were only 16 active drill rigs in Colombia, which while 2 more than a month earlier is nearly half of the 30 operating at the end of April 2019.
  Related: IEA Drops Bombshell Report On Oil And Gas  Source: Baker Hughes Rig Count and U.S. EIA. A key reason for the sharp decline in drilling activity is a lack of investment. According to Colombia’s leading industry body the Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP – Spanish initials) oil companies will invest (Spanish) $3.1 to $3.45 billion during 2021. While that is significantly higher than the $2.05 billion invested in 2020, it is still substantially less than $4.03 billion industry investment made during 2019. Colombia’s high breakeven prices, estimated to be around $40 to $45 per barrel after-tax, are a deterrent to investment. Breakeven prices for onshore oil projects in the Andean country is significantly higher than many other Latin American jurisdictions including offshore Brazil and Guyana.
  Colombia’s primary crude oil grades are Castilla, Magdalena and Vasconia which have API gravities of 18.8, 20 and 24.3 degrees with sulfur contents of 1.97%, 1.6% and 0.83%, respectively. Demand from refiners for sour medium and heavy crude oil varieties is falling because of the global push to reduce sulfur emissions, which led to the introduction of IMO2020 at the start of last year which capped sulfur emissions for maritime fuels. Heavier sour crude oil grades are also more costly and difficult to refine into high grade gasoline, diesel and other fuels than lighter sweeter varieties of crude oil. For those reasons Colombia’s crude oil grades sell at a notable discount to Brent, which during times of market stress had historically widened considerably. During March 2020, when a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia emerged, Vasconia was selling at a $7.75 per barrel discount to Brent, but by March 2021 that discount had eased to be around $5 per barrel. That is also weighing on foreign investment in Colombia’s struggling and economically vital petroleum industry. A spike in violence in the strife-torn Andean country poses a threat to oil industry operations. Colombia has been rocked by anti-government protests for nearly three weeks and blockades have been set-up on major roads preventing in some regions, especially around the country’s third largest city Cali, the movement of people and goods. Violent incursions into oilfields, notably in Colombia’s east around the municipality of Puerto Gaitan in the Llanos Basin, are intensifying as the petroleum industry’s social license unravels. Heightened political turmoil and elevated conflict are weighing on foreign investment in Colombia’s economically vital oil industry. The combination of weaker oil prices, the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing security crisis and weaker than expected oil production are sharply impacting Colombia’s economy. Bogota’s 2021 budget deficit is expected to reach 9% of gross domestic product, the March 2021 unemployment rate stood at 14% and first quarter 2021 GDP plunged 9% compared to the previous quarter. The contribution of petroleum extraction to Colombia’s first quarter 2021 GDP fell almost 4% quarter over quarter and by 15% compared to a year earlier, despite oil prices rallying significantly since the start of 2021 to see Brent up by around 36%. Those poor numbers indicate how important it is for Bogota to restart Colombia’s economically crucial petroleum industry, which is struggling to reach a pre-pandemic tempo of operations because of a third viral wave and heightened violence. The Duque administration’s inadequate management of the pandemic and inability to reactivate the hydrocarbon sector, coupled with its impotence when it comes to controlling rising lawlessness, poses a direct threat to Colombia’s economic recovery. "
IEA Net Zero Goal Means No More New Oil And Gas Investment Ever.html,"The world doesn’t need any new investments in oil and gas beyond what is already approved if it hopes to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday, adding that the road to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius involves a rapid and radical shift away from fossil fuels. According to the IEA’s pathway to net-zero emissions by 2050, the world will not need new oil and gas projects beyond those sanctioned as of this year, the Paris-based agency said in its Net Zero by 2050 report published today. Instead, all new energy investments should be of the renewable variety in what the IEA refers to as an “immediate and massive deployment of all available clean and efficient energy technologies.” The agency’s ‘Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector’ also says that no new coal mines or mine extensions are required if the world is to achieve net-zero emissions in 2050.
 “The path to net?zero emissions is narrow: staying on it requires immediate and massive deployment of all available clean and efficient energy technologies,” the agency said. The scenario with the world reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 would mean a sharp decline in demand for fossil fuels, “meaning that the focus for oil and gas producers switches entirely to output – and emissions reductions – from the operation of existing assets,” the IEA said. “No new oil and natural gas fields are needed in the net zero pathway, and supplies become increasingly concentrated in a small number of low-cost producers.” The pathway to achieving net-zero would result in coal demand collapsing by 90 percent by 2050 and natural gas demand slumping by 55 percent, the IEA noted. Oil demand would plunge by as much as 75 percent to just 24 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2050, from around 100 million bpd in 2019.  Related: Iran Is Planning An Oil Export Boost
 “Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 will require nothing short of the complete transformation of the global energy system,” the agency said. The IEA, however, noted that such a transformation would also pose new energy security risks, while the old security risks would not go away. Even in a scenario in which oil demand is plunging, supplies will become increasingly concentrated in a small number of low-cost producers. OPEC’s share of a much-reduced global oil supply would surge from around 37 percent in recent years to 52 percent in 2050, “a level higher than at any point in the history of oil markets,” according to the IEA. In the clean energy transition, the energy security risks will include the variability of supply, cybersecurity risks, and the growing dependence on critical minerals, the agency said.  "
Why A Shale Comeback Could Be Disastrous For Oil Markets.html,"After having a year to forget in 2020, the energy sector has this year emerged as the best-performing of all 11 U.S. market sectors. Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLE) is up 41% in the year-to-date, making the broader market S&P 500’s 11% gain appear downright anemic. Oil prices appear to have stabilized in the upper 60s, with WTI price finding support around $63 per barrel while Brent is seeing support around $65 per barrel. The sector has a successful Covid-19 vaccination rollout and gradual recovery of the global economy to thank for the resurgence, with several countries—including the U.S. and much of Europe—having reopened their economies. But even more important is OPEC’s continuing production discipline with the organization sticking to earlier plans to only gradually increase production in its latest meeting. OPEC+ has cut output by around 8 million barrels per day (bpd), but has now agreed to bring 2.1 million bpd back to the market from May to July, easing cuts to 5.8 million bpd. But experts are now warning that OPEC+, responsible for more than a third of global production, could see its efforts thwarted by a chief rival: U.S. shale. According to an analysis by the authoritative Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, rising oil prices could allow for a significant return of U.S. shale to the market in 2022, potentially upsetting the delicate rebalancing of the global oil market. Related: 3 Strong Oil And Gas Stocks For The Summer 
 “As we enter 2022, the US shale response becomes a major source of uncertainty amid an uneven recovery across shale plays and players alike. As in previous cycles, US shale will remain a key factor shaping market outcomes,” Institute Director Bassam Fattouh and analyst Andreas Economou have said. Market surplus The institute lays out several possible scenarios, including some that could lead to an oil surplus. During its latest meeting+, OPEC+ said it expects global oil demand to increase by 6 million barrels a day during the second half of the year. It said it saw stocks at about 70 million barrels below the average for the whole of 2021, a more optimistic outlook than its previous forecast of 20 million barrels below the average. But the Oxford analysts say that an expected increase in shale output by 0.95 million barrels per day could be easily absorbed by the market unless the global recovery hits a major snag. However, Fattouh and Economou have warned that the market could flip into a surplus by the fourth quarter of 2022 if the U.S. shale growth hits the upper bound of 1.22 million barrels per day and global demand recovery turns out to be slower than expected. Shale recovery
  Source: Reuters What we find alarming about the Oxford report is that it might only take a partial recovery by the U.S. shale industry for the effects of the extra oil to start being felt. U.S. shale producers cut more than 2 million barrels per day last year after oil prices plunged to historical lows.  Related: Hackers Behind U.S. Pipeline Attack Say They Lost Access To Ransom Money However, many shale companies have been ramping up production as oil prices continue climbing.  And that includes companies that have affected the deepest cuts. For instance, Texas-based shale producer ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) earned itself accolades after announcing some of the deepest production cuts at a time when many shale companies were reluctant to lower production and relinquish market share. The company lowered its North American output by nearly 500,000 bpd, marking one of the biggest cuts by an American producer. However, in its latest earnings call, COP revealed that Q1 production, excluding Libya, climbed 16.4% Y/Y to 1.49M boe/day, a good 30% above the 1.14M boe/day output in Q4 2020.  COP issued upbeat guidance, saying it expects Q2 production, excluding Libya, of 1.5M-1.54M boe/day due to seasonal turnarounds planned in Europe and Asia Pacific. U.S. rig count has been steadily creeping up. The key rig count is set to rise to 602 by year-end, a big jump from the 13-year low of 222 rigs last summer. While the direct relationship between rigs and production is complex, the Oxford analysts have concluded that rising shale output could affect the careful calculations of OPEC+."
Oil Markets Will Face A Supply Crisis Before Demand Peaks.html,"The year 2020 was a watershed moment for the fossil fuel sector. Faced with a global pandemic, severe demand shocks, and a shift towards renewable energy, experts warned that nearly $900 billion worth of reserves--or about one-third of the value of big oil and gas companies--were at risk of becoming worthless. Big Oil appears to have mostly resigned itself to this fate. Last year, British oil giant BP Plc. (NYSE:BP) sent shockwaves through the oil and gas sector after it declared that the world was already past Peak Oil demand. In the company's 2020 Energy Outlook, chief executive Bernard Looney pledged that BP would increase its renewables spending twentyfold to $5 billion a year by 2030 and ""... not enter any new countries for oil and gas exploration.""  BP--company that doubled down on its aggressive drilling strategy right after the historic 2015 UN Climate Change Agreement--finally appeared to throw in the towel, saying, ""..concerns about carbon emissions and climate change mean that it is increasingly unlikely that the world's reserves of oil will ever be exhausted."" BP went on to announce one of the largest asset writedowns of any oil major after slashing up to $17.5 billion off the value of its assets and conceded that it ""expects the pandemic to hasten the shift away from fossil fuels."" It's a refrain that was shared by several oil executives, with Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) CEO Ben van Beurden declaring that we were already past peak oil demand. The vast majority of oil and gas companies, including supermajors such as ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Inc.(NYSE:CVX), announced deep spending cuts in 2020, with Capex reduction exceeding $85 billion. Yet, an ironic twist of fate might mean that rather than huge oil and gas reserves remaining buried deep in the ground, the world could very well run out of those commodities in our lifetimes.  Related: Iran Is Planning An Oil Export Boost Indeed, delving deeper into the global oil and gas outlook suggests that it's peak oil supply, not peak oil demand, that's likely to start dominating headlines as the years roll on. Peak Oil Demand  Source: Bloomberg Peak Oil Demand When many analysts talk about Peak Oil, they are usually referring to that point in time when global oil demand will enter a phase of terminal and irreversible decline. According to BP, this point has already come and gone, with oil demand slated to fall by at least 10% in the current decade and by as much as 50% over the next two. BP notes that historically, energy demand has risen steadily in tandem with global economic growth with few exceptions; however, the COVID-19 crisis and increased climate action might have permanently altered that playbook. BP has modeled 3 possible scenarios for the future of global fuel and electricity demand: Business as Usual, Rapid Transition, and Net Zero. Here's the kicker: BP says that even under the most optimistic scenario where energy policy keeps evolving at pretty much the pace it is today (Business as Usual) oil demand will still suffer declines-- only at a later date and at a slower pace compared to the other two scenarios. The oil bulls, however, can take comfort in the fact that under the Business-as-Usual scenario, BP sees oil demand remaining at 2018 levels of 97-98 million barrels per day till 2030 before falling to 94 million barrels per day in 2040 and eventually to 89 million barrels per day three decades from now. That's a loss in demand of less than 1% per year through 2050. However, things could look very different under the other two scenarios that entail aggressive government policies aimed at reaching net-zero status by 2050 as well as carbon prices and other interventions aimed at limiting global warming. Under the Rapid Transition scenario (moderately aggressive), BP sees oil demand falling 10% by 2030 and nearly 15% under Net Zero (most aggressive). In other words, the decline in oil demand is bound to be catastrophic for the industry over the next decade under any other scenario other than Business-as-Usual. 
 Luckily, this is the scenario that's likely to dominate over the next decade. David Blackmon, a Texas-based independent energy analyst/consultant, has told Forbes that many analysts are skeptical about BP's grim outlook. Indeed, Blackmon says a ""Business as Usual"" scenario appears the most likely path for the time being, given the time the global economy might take to recover from Covid-19 as well as the trillions of dollars that would be required to implement the other two cases.  Related Video: Iraq Eyes Exxon Stake and New OPEC Status Further, it's important to note that BP made those projections before Covid-19 vaccines had entered the fray. With countries such as the United States having rolled out successful vaccination programs and even started reopening their economies, the global oil and gas outlook has improved considerably. Peak Oil Supply Though less frequently discussed seriously, Peak Oil Supply remains a distinct possibility over the next couple of years. In the past, supply-side ""peak oil"" theories mostly turned out to be wrong mainly because their proponents invariably underestimated the enormity of yet-to-be-discovered resources. In more recent years, demand-side ""peak oil"" theory has always managed to overestimate the ability of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles to displace fossil fuels.  Then, of course, few could have foretold the explosive growth of U.S. shale that added 13 million barrels per day to global supply from just 1-2 million b/d in the space of just a decade. It's ironic that the shale crisis is likely to be responsible for triggering Peak Oil Supply. In an excellent op/ed, vice chairman of IHS Markit Dan Yergin observes that it's almost inevitable that shale output will go in reverse and decline thanks to drastic cutbacks in investment and only later recover at a slow pace. Shale oil wells decline at an exceptionally fast clip and therefore require constant drilling to replenish lost supply.  Indeed, Norway-based energy consultancy Rystad Energy recently warned that Big Oil could see its proven reserves run out in less than 15 years, thanks to produced volumes not being fully replaced with new discoveries. According to Rystad, proven oil and gas reserves by the so-called Big Oil companies, namely ExxonMobil, BP Plc., Shell, Chevron, Total (NYSE:TOT), and Eni S.p.A are falling, as produced volumes are not being fully replaced with new discoveries.  Source: Oil and Gas Journal Dwindling reserves Massive impairment charges saw Big Oil's proven reserves drop by 13 billion boe, good for ~15% of its stock levels in the ground, last year. Rystad now says that the remaining reserves are set to run out in less than 15 years unless Big Oil makes more commercial discoveries quickly. The main culprit: Rapidly shrinking exploration investments. Global oil and gas companies cut their capex by a staggering 34% in 2020, in response to shrinking demand and investors growing weary of persistently poor returns by the sector. The trend shows no signs of moderating: First quarter discoveries totalled 1.2 billion boe, the lowest in 7 years with successful wildcats only yielding modest-sized finds as per Rystad.
 ExxonMobil, whose proven reserves shrank by 7 billion boe in 2020, or 30%, from 2019 levels, was the worst hit after major reductions in Canadian oil sands and US shale gas properties.  Shell, meanwhile, saw its proven reserves fall by 20% to 9 billion boe last year; Chevron lost 2 billion boe of proven reserves due to impairment charges while BP lost 1 boe. Only Total and Eni have avoided reductions in proven reserves over the past decade. Climate activism Yet, policy changes by Biden's administration, as well as fever-pitch climate activism, are likely to make it really hard for Big Oil to go back to its trigger-happy drilling days. In his first three months in office, Joe Biden has rejoined the Paris climate agreement, scuppered a controversial oil pipeline, suspended fossil fuel leases on public land, proposed unprecedented investment in clean energy, and started to reverse many of his predecessor's regulatory rollbacks. In a virtual climate summit with 41 world leaders last month, President Joe Biden unveiled an ambitious 10-year Climate Plan that has proposed cutting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% by 2030. That represents a near-doubling of the U.S. commitment of a 26-28% cut under the Obama administration following the Paris Agreement of 2015. Biden had even proposed a carbon tax, though it was conspicuously absent in his latest climate policy. Meanwhile, the world's biggest asset manager BlackRock, has been doubling down on oil and gas divestitures. Back in 2019, BlackRock declared its intention to increase its ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) investments more than tenfold from $90 billion to a trillion dollars in the space of a decade. But now the firm is pushing out the goalposts on climate action and wants companies that he invests in to disclose how they plan to achieve a net-zero economy, which he has defined as eliminating net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. BlackRock plans to put oil and gas companies under the clamps by creating a ""temperature alignment metric"" for both its public equity and bond funds with explicit temperature alignment goals, including products aligned to a net-zero pathway. Climate activists, including the Sierra Club, have been bombarding BlackRock and Vanguard with calls and emails urging them to vote against Exxon Mobil's CEO Darren Woods, saying Exxon's board ""needs an overhaul"" to better manage climate risks and guide the company to a low carbon future. Business unusual During last month's CERAWeek by IHS Markit energy conference, it became abundantly clear that Big Oil wants to focus not so much on curtailing oil and gas production but rather on mitigating the impact of its carbon and greenhouse gas emissions.  According to Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods and Occidental Petroleum's (NYSE:OXY) Vicky Hollub, reducing carbon emissions from fossil fuels and not the actual use of fossil fuels, offers the best way to combat climate change.  Interestingly, both CEOs have stressed that the world still needs oil and gas, and governments need to focus on mitigating global warming using technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) instead of attacking fossil fuels. Nevertheless, even the biggest hardliner of them all, Exxon Mobil, has markedly changed its tune from just a few years back. During the company's 2021 Investor Day, CEO Darren Woods outlined the company's energy transition strategy, including plans to trim production growth and boost cash flows in a bid to support a growing dividend. Exxon revealed that it plans to hold production flat from 2020 levels through 2025 at 3.7M boe/day, good for a 26% cut from the 5M boe/day estimate for 2025 it released just a year ago. In other words, it's going to be really hard for Big Oil to continue with business as usual despite an oil price recovery, meaning the prospects of a major oil supply crunch remains very real."
OPECs Oil Exports Are Surging By 1 Million Bpd In May.html,"OPEC’s oil exports have jumped by 1 million barrels per day (bpd) so far in May, while the OPEC+ group started easing the production cuts by 350,000 bpd this month, tanker tracker Petro-Logistics said on Monday. At the ministerial meeting in early April, the OPEC+ group decided to gradually return over 1 million bpd to the market between May and July. The OPEC+ collective oil production is set to rise by 350,000 bpd in both May and June and by more than 400,000 bpd in July. Additionally, Saudi Arabia will also gradually ease its extra unilateral cut of 1 million bpd over the course of the next few months, beginning with monthly production increases of 250,000 bpd in both May and June. Overall, OPEC+ is expected to return to the market as much as 2.1 million bpd by July.  
 The decision from early April signaled the confidence of the leaders of the OPEC+ alliance that the market would be able to absorb that much supply as vaccination programs are accelerating and people start traveling more. OPEC+ and all analysts expect global oil demand to rebound strongly in the second half of 2021 and nearly reach pre-crisis levels by the end of the fourth quarter this year. Goldman Sachs said at the end of April that it expects global oil demand to realize “the biggest jump in oil demand ever” the next six months. The investment bank sees oil demand jumping by 5.2 million bpd over the next six months.
 Despite the recent bearish concerns surrounding India’s COVID crisis, OPEC, investment banks, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) are optimistic that global oil demand is set for a strong rise this year. The excess oil inventories of the past year have been all but depleted, the IEA said last week, noting that “The widening supply and demand gap paves the way for a further easing of OPEC+ supply cuts or even sharper stock draws.”  "
India Oil Demand Slumps By 20 In May Amid COVID Crisis.html,"Fuel demand in India continues to slump this month amid the COVID crisis in the world’s third-largest oil importer, with gasoline sales down to a one-year low and diesel consumption dropping to the lowest in seven months in the first two weeks of May. Sales of gasoline and diesel plunged by 20 percent in the period May 1-15 compared to April, when demand was already deteriorating, sources with knowledge of data from the three biggest fuel retailers told Bloomberg. Compared to the same weeks in 2020, road fuel sales plummeted by 28 percent, according to the sources familiar with preliminary data of the sales of Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, which, combined, account for 90 percent of India’s sales of fuels.
 Most of India has been under local lockdowns since April when the resurgence of COVID started to overwhelm the healthcare system. The central government, however, is resisting calls for a nationwide lockdown, fearing a backlash on economic growth. As India continues to fight the COVID resurgence, the infections are now spreading to rural areas. Daily new cases are now below the peak of over 400,000 from early May, but on Friday, the country reported a third consecutive day of more than 4,000 deaths. Due to the COVID crisis, Indian fuel demand plunged by 9.4 percent in April compared to March, according to official data cited by Press Trust of India last week.
 Oil demand in India is the main drag on the expected lower-than-previously-thought global oil demand this quarter, OPEC warned in its monthly report last week. The cartel, however, is optimistic that accelerating vaccination programs and rising fuel demand will raise global oil demand by 5.95 million barrels per day (bpd) this year despite the current COVID crisis in India, and kept its 2021 demand outlook unchanged from last month."
Russia Has Oil Reserves At Least Until 2080.html,"Russia’s oil reserves will last until 2080 at the current pace of annual production, Natural Resources Minister Alexander Kozlov told Russian outlet RBC in an interview this week. Russia also has natural gas reserves for another 103 years of annual production at current output levels, the minister said. Russia’s actual oil and gas reserves could even rise if it steps up exploration in hard-to-drill areas, the minister added, noting that Russia needs to develop exploration, including in hard-to-reach areas.
 Last month, Evgeny Kiselev, the head of the Russian Federal Agency for Mineral Resources, told state outlet Rossiyskaya Gazeta that Russia has 58 years worth of oil reserves, of which 19 years to profitably pump those reserves at current levels with current technology. Advances in technology, however, will constantly push back the deadline. Asked how long Russia would have oil reserves, Kiselev said “indefinitely.” Oil and gas export revenues are key to Russia’s budget income. Oil price collapses like last year’s lead to belt-tightening policies despite Moscow’s insistence that it can live with $30 oil.  Related: U.S. Oil Rig Count Soars As WTI Recovers
 Russia’s production fell last year and is set for slight growth this year and next, according to government data and estimates. After setting a post-Soviet high in oil and condensate production in 2019, Russia saw its output drop by 8.6 percent in 2020 due to the lower global demand and low oil prices, as well as the OPEC+ production cuts. Russia’s crude oil and condensate production fell in 2020 for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis and then slump in oil prices, according to government statistics.   Last month, Russia cut its estimates for domestic crude oil, gas, and coal production for 2021 and 2022, but kept the estimates for the oil production for 2023 and 2024 unchanged. As per the latest forecasts from the Russian government, oil production this year is set to stand at 517 million tons, down from a previous estimate of 560 million tons. The projection for Russia’s oil output in 2022 was also reduced, to 548 million tons, down from earlier estimates of production of 558 million tons."
Can Canada Boost Oil Production While Reducing Emissions.html,"Canada has recently increased its climate commitment by announcing a more ambitious mid-term target for 2030 on its path to net-zero by 2050. Still, the federal government expects crude oil production to continue growing and peak only a decade before 2050. This glaring discrepancy signals that the industry, the province of Alberta, and the federal government should boost cooperation and increase investment and commitment in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, especially from the oil sands production, which is more carbon-intensive than most other ways to pump crude.     Environmental organizations are calling for a reduction of oil sands production as the easiest way to cut emissions and criticized the recent federal government climate pledges as not ambitious enough. The oil and gas industry, for its part, is looking to cut emissions to clean up the image of the oil sands, whose high emissions prompted oil majors to divest assets in Canada just after the previous oil price crash in 2015-2016. Related Video: COVID Threatens Oil Sands Supply from Canada  Last year, France’s Total booked US$8.1 billion impairments—of which US$7 billion in Canada’s oil sands—as it cut its short-term price expectations. Total identified the Canadian oil sands projects Fort Hills and Surmont as “stranded” assets in light of its pledges for carbon neutrality.   “The Biggest Industry In The Country” The fact remains that the oil and gas industry is a major contributor to Canada’s economy, especially in the biggest oil-producing province of Alberta. Despite the layoffs during the 2020 oil price and demand collapse, the sector still supports hundreds of thousands of direct jobs. A transition to low-carbon energy must also come with a plan to relocate or reskill workers to ensure that the climate ambitions do not lead to higher unemployment.
 Last year, Canada’s federal government was ready to help the industry, which it sees as crucial to its economy and economic recovery after the pandemic. “This is the biggest industry in the country. It’s our biggest export, so there is a lot on the line for everybody,” Federal Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan said in June. Canada’s crude oil production is set to grow from 4.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019 to 5.8 million bpd in 2039, when crude output is expected to peak, according to estimates from the Canada Energy Regulator. This projection is under the so-called Evolving Scenario, which assumes increasing action on climate and low-carbon technologies development. Fossil fuels will still make up over 60 percent of Canada’s fuel mix in 2050, according to the estimate. “Achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 will require an accelerated pace of transition away from fossil fuels,” Canada Energy Regulator said. Canada Strengthens Climate Action Pledges           Last month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canada would enhance its emissions reduction target under the Paris Agreement and now aims to cut those emissions by 40-45 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The country also doubled down on its commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The plan was criticized by environmentalists not only for falling short of the new U.S. climate target of reducing carbon emissions by up to 52 percent by 2030, but also for its incompatibility with expectations that the oil sands industry would grow over the next nearly two decades.  Related: Is The Global Oil Industry Relying Too Much On China? “The Trudeau government has not come to grips with the fact that an expanding tar sands industry is fundamentally incompatible with both Canada’s aspirations for climate leadership or a global economy transitioning to clean forms of energy,” said Anthony Swift, Canada Project director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. While strengthening emissions reduction targets, Canada’s government forecasts “a rapidly expanding tar sands industry that would export into a global market for oil that is fundamentally inconsistent with meaningful international action on climate,” Swift said.
 Energy Industry Works To Slash Emissions, Produce Hydrogen The energy industry, as well as Alberta’s government, recognize the need to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions if oil sands had the chance to still have “license to operate” in the energy transition. The oil sands account for 12 percent of Canada’s total greenhouse gas emissions and 0.2 percent of global emissions, according to government data. Between 2000 and 2018, the emission intensity of oil sands operations dropped by around 36 percent due to technological and efficiency improvements, fewer venting emissions, and reductions in the percentage of crude bitumen being upgraded to synthetic crude oil, the federal government says. “If we want the oil sands to be able to continue to grow production, we need to get emissions down,” Alberta’s energy minister Sonya Savage said at a conference last month, as carried by the Financial Times. Alberta is betting on emissions-reduction efforts and its position as a major oil producer that is not associated with the price-fixing policies of OPEC+ as a more responsible producer of crude than countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, or Russia.   Alberta also looks to develop more carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects to abate emissions, as well as “blue” hydrogen from its vast natural gas resources using CCUS technology. Alberta “is well-positioned to become a world leader in hydrogen development, and is already one in CCUS,” Savage said last month.  “We don’t always see eye-to-eye with the federal government on energy,” Savage told FT. “But in hydrogen we do.”  "
Middle East Oil Producers Race To Pump Crude And Sell Assets.html,"Within the last month, Saudi Arabia’s state oil giant Aramco has announced the sale of a minority—but large—stake in its pipeline business, the possibility to sell another 1 percent of its stock, and intentions to put up for sale stakes in some oil fields. Neighbor, ally, and fellow OPEC member UAE in the meantime, has announced plans to list its state oil firm’s drilling business and has launched its own oil futures in a bid to change the face of Middle Eastern oil. There is a certain feeling that both Saudi Arabia and the UAE are in a rush to make the most of their oil, with both Aramco and Adnoc also making public their intentions to boost their oil production capacity. On the face of it, the reason for the divestments and capacity boosts is obvious enough: all Gulf economies depend on their oil revenues to keep going, and all of them have been hit hard by the demand destruction that the pandemic caused last year. Yet there is also something else—Gulf economies are wary of oil demand peak forecasts. Besides stake sells, listings, and plans to pump more oil, they are also trying to diversify their economies away from oil. For that, they need as much oil money as they can make. Goldman Sachs recently said that global oil demand could peak by 2026, joining a host of various entities seeing a grim future for the world’s most traded commodity. “Government policies driving higher efficiency gains and lower emissions have had the strongest bearing on road transport demand,” Goldman analysts said in a report. “Petrochemicals will become the new baseload for oil demand, driven by economic growth and rising consumption, especially in emerging markets.” Related Video: Massive American Pipeline Shut Down in Cyber Attack
  Norwegian energy consultancy Rystad Energy also foresees peak oil demand in 2026, citing the rapid adoption of electric vehicles as the probable cause of its revised forecast, which earlier saw oil demand peaking in 2028. Basically, the long-term outlook for oil-dependent economies is not particularly good.  A recent Energy Intelligence overview on the topic cited, in addition to the stake sales, the production expansion plans of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, which represent a reversal of the long-standing policy of saving oil and gas reserves for future generations. Indeed, this seems like the clearest sign yet that the oil-dependent Gulf economies are worried there may be no need to save their oil and gas reserves for future generations. Perhaps Qatar is a different case, however. The tiny Gulf nation recently announced plans to substantially boost its LNG production capacity. It should be noted, however, that this is happening in a market where demand is set to grow for quite some time, even as the world moves from fossil fuels to a post-fossil fuel era. At the same time, competition is intensifying, so to retain its spot as lead exporter, Qatar needs to do whatever it can, including boosting production. Of course, nothing is set in stone, including the mass adoption of EVs. A recent study from the University of California, for instance, found that close to a fifth of EV drivers switched back to a gasoline car in the period between 2012 and 2018. The reason was that charging was too much hassle. Charging times haven’t shortened much since 2018, so the problem remains.  Related: OPEC Continues To See Strong Oil Demand Recovery In 2021 In the meantime, growing Asian economies are building new coal-powered generation capacity, led by China, which is also the leader in new renewable power capacity.
 Why? “Because renewable energy (sources such as) wind and solar power are intermittent and unstable, we must rely on a stable power source,” says Su Wei, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Development and Reform Commission, as quoted by CNBC. “We have no other choice. For a period of time, we may need to use coal power as a point of flexible adjustment.” The statement of the Chinese government official echoes what some Big Oil chiefs have said recently. Despite their ambitious energy transition plans, both the CEOs of Shell and BP have said on separate occasions that until there is demand for their main product, they will continue producing it, and there is still demand for their main product. Be that as it may, Gulf producers are doing the only smart thing they can: the future is uncertain, and the pendulum could swing either way. Still, it’s best to be on the safe side and make do with the resources they have while demand is still robust. The idea of peak oil supply has been refuted, anyway, so even if the energy transition plans of so many governments fail, there will still be oil and gas for future generations. If those plans materialize, however, the Gulf oil nations would do well to prepare for a time when their oil production will need to fall to reflect much smaller demand driven by the continuing need for petrochemicals and plastics, which will continue to be popular over the long term, too."
Can Libyas Oil Industry Make A Comeback In 2021.html,"The creation of Libya’s interim government has instilled the international community with tacit hopes of a decade-long conflict finally coming to an end. As it is oftentimes the case with Libya, aspirations remain alive only insofar as they are not accompanied by deadlines to be met. The interim government has a little less than 2 months to “create the constitutional basis” for the Libya’s first democratic elections of this century (assumed to take place in December 2021). The complete unpredictability of what is going to happen next has been delaying much-needed investment into Libya, with most investors (even those who happen to have equity) fearing another landslide into all-out mayhem is still on the cards. Against all this, Libya has been trying to struggle its way through another round of plummeting differentials. The force majeure, initiated mid-April by Libya’s NOC that debilitated operations at the Marsa el-Hariga Terminal (loading Sarir and Mesla grades), took less than 2 weeks to overcome. AGOCO, the NOC’s fully-owned upstream subsidiary, claimed the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) did not transfer its income in due time – reportedly not a single Libyan dinar since September 2020 - compelling the firm to wrap up operations. It took CBL exactly one week to wire 230 million USD to AGOCO’s account and within several days the port of Hariga was loading cargoes again. By early May all fields connected to Marsa el-Hariga were reported to be running at peak capacity. This, of course, does not eliminate the risk of further disputes, especially on highly contentious issues like reporting oil revenues where the underlying causes of discord remains simmering under the surface. Usually Libya’s NOC issues its official selling prices (OSP) for the upcoming month on the last week of the month preceding the loading. For the second time already this year, it had delayed the OSP issuance into the actual month of loading, taking roughly a week more than it generally should. Following the market ruckus caused by the force majeure, NOC probably wanted to wait for the mayhem to abate. Still, it was induced to decrease prices even further, especially the light sweet ones. El Sharara suffered the most marked depreciation month-on-month, dropping 40 cents to -1.8 USD per barrel against Dated. Smaller flows like Brega, Bu Attifel and Zueitina were hiked by 20 cents per barrel; all the other grades saw insignificant month-on-month changes or were just simply rolled over. Interestingly, Sarir and Mesla, the two grades that have suffered from the force majeure, were also left unchanged.  Related: Big Oil Eyes Wave Of Buybacks After Blowout Earnings  With Libya’s largest crude flow - Es Sider - lingering at its lowest differentials ever, Libyan energy authorities are closely following the intense competition with incoming US grades as well as Mediterranean peers such as CPC or Azeri, hoping for their influx to ease. This might well be a pipe dream, at least temporarily, considering that US crude arrivals to Europe in May 2021 are at their highest since September 2020 and the tally might still edge higher from its current level of 24 MMbbls (the sailing time is usually 18-20 days so the final number could only be assessed mid-month). In addition, the gradual winding-down of OPEC+ production quotas has lifted crude production rates (just to name one example from the ranks of Libya’s competitors, this year’s CPC output target is 150kbpd higher than in 2020, at 1.44mbpd) and the wide Brent-Dubai spread has killed off most of the previously existing arbitrage opportunities. Hypothetically, Libya could channel more crude into other streams and thus optimize its revenues by placing more emphasis on crude streams that it believes to hold higher value. However, for this happen Libya would ideally need the liberty to choose which plays or deposits it would prefer to develop; that is hardly what Tripoli has now after 10 years of fratricidal conflict. Perhaps unfortunately for Libya’s NOC, a significant part of Libya’s prospective fields to be commissioned will be channeled into Es Sider flows – the Dahra and Bahi fields are currently being refurbished and will bring in some 20kbpd once they reach their assumed plateau at some point later this year; North Gialo and Gialo III (the two combined have a nameplate capacity of 150kbpd) might take several years to launch but should bring the total Es Sider flows to 500kbpd. Related Video: Massive American Pipeline Shut Down in Cyber Attack Thus, Libya has found itself in a limbo whereby the short-term prospects of its oil industry ultimately depend on not just one but several key factors. These can be categorized along the following dilemmas:
 - could the interim government manage to navigate Libya to an election without new flare-ups of fighting? - will light sweet differentials improve over time so that Libyan grades garner more?- when will the arbitrage towards Asia reopen and how long would it last? The most important point of agenda, of course, is the political unity of Libya – without it the Libyan NOC will not be able to breathe new life into exploration drilling and to allocate new acreage, not to speak of even more delicate tasks such as tweaking the country’s (oftentimes outdated) 1955 Petroleum Code."
OPEC Continues To See Strong Oil Demand Recovery In 2021.html,"OPEC is optimistic that accelerating vaccination programs and rising fuel demand will raise global oil demand by 5.95 million barrel per day (bpd) this year despite the current COVID crisis in India, the cartel said on Tuesday, keeping its demand outlook unchanged from last month. World oil demand is set to average 96.5 million bpd in 2021, OPEC said in its closely-watched Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) today. This would be nearly 6 million bpd higher than the demand last year, with the acceleration expected in the second half of 2021. OPEC revised down its estimates for global oil demand for the second quarter by 300,000 bpd due to lower-than-expected demand in North America in the first quarter and the COVID resurgence in India and Brazil. However, the organization raised its outlook for oil demand for both the third and fourth quarters of 2021 by 150,000 bpd and 290,000 bpd, respectively. The higher anticipated demand in the second half of this year is the result of positive fuel data from the United States, while “the acceleration in vaccination programs in many regions allows for optimism,” OPEC said.
 Regions such as the Middle East and Asia except China are also expected to benefit from some sort of return to normality in the second half of 2021. Among developed economies, the biggest contributor to demand will be the United States and North America as a whole, although demand is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels this year. “Rebounding transportation fuels, mainly gasoline, in addition to healthy light- and middle-distillate requirements are assumed to support the oil demand recovery going forward,” OPEC noted.
 Non-OPEC supply for this year was revised down by 230,000 bpd, mainly due to the Texas Freeze in February. OPEC now sees the total oil supply from non-OPEC nations growing by 700,000 bpd year over year in 2021.  "
OPECs Production Increases As Iran Ramps Up Output.html,"OPEC’s crude oil production is estimated to have increased to a three-month high of 24.96 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, thanks to a major jump in Iran’s output, the latest survey by Argus showed. Other surveys of analysts and ship-tracking data also suggest that OPEC either boosted or maintained its crude oil production flat last month, ahead of the planned increase of 600,000 bpd from the OPEC+ coalition in May. OPEC will announce official data on the cartel’s production in its Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) on Tuesday, May 11. According to the Argus survey, OPEC boosted its crude oil production by 70,000 bpd in April, primarily due to an 80,000-bpd increase in Iran’s oil production which rose to a nearly two-year high. Iran, exempted from the OPEC+ cuts, is estimated to have pumped 2.35 million bpd in April, overtaking Kuwait as OPEC’s fourth-largest producer and posting its highest production since May 2019.  
 Before the U.S. sanctions from 2018, Iran was OPEC’s third-biggest producer behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq. The monthly Reuters survey also found that OPEC likely raised its oil production in April, driven by another supply increase from Iran. Iran raised its oil production by as much as 200,000 bpd in April compared to March to reach an output of 2.5 million bpd, the Reuters survey showed. Related Video: Massive American Pipeline Shut Down in Cyber Attack Iran ramped up its output by 60,000 bpd to 2.41 million bpd in April, as per the Bloomberg survey of ship-tracking data, estimates from consultancies, and information from officials. According to the Bloomberg survey, a large drop in Libyan supply because of a wage dispute at an oil terminal offset the Iranian increase in production.
 Iran is estimated to have not only raised its production, but also its oil exports in recent months despite the U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude exports. Independent refiners in the world’s top oil importer, China, are said to be buying most of Iran’s oil that circumvents the American sanctions. The Islamic Republic is raising its production as the talks about bringing the United States and Iran back into the so-called Iran nuclear deal have intensified and made some progress in recent weeks."
Hedge Funds Increase Bullish Bets On Oil.html,"Money managers have accelerated buying in the most important petroleum futures and options contracts, betting that oil prices will increase later this year as economies reopen and travel and fuel demand rise. In the week to May 4, hedge funds bought the equivalent of 40 million barrels in the most important contracts, led by increased bullish bets on WTI Crude and Brent Crude, according to data from exchanges compiled by Reuters columnist John Kemp. This was the fourth week in a row in which portfolio managers have added long positions in oil futures.
 In the week to April 27, hedge funds added the equivalent of 30 million barrels in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts. At the time, this was the most bullish position in the oil complex in more than two and a half months, with the net long in crude oil futures jumping to the highest in six weeks. In the past few weeks, signs of oil demand recovery trumped bearish news such as India’s records in daily coronavirus cases as market participants expect the reopening of major developed economies to lead to increased travel and fuel demand for the rest of the year. Both Brent and WTI saw increased net long position—the difference between bullish and bearish bets—in the week to May 4. The increased net long “was predominantly driven by fresh longs entering the market,” ING strategists Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao said on Monday.
 Oil prices posted weekly gains in the past two weeks, for a first such back-to-back weekly gain in nearly two months. Bullish demand outlooks thanks to the reopening in the United States and Europe and draws in U.S. crude oil inventories have mostly prevailed over the concerns about a slowdown in oil demand in the world’s third-largest oil importer, India."
Chinese Oil Imports Dropped 11 In April.html,"China’s crude oil imports in April fell by 11 percent, according to energy analytics firm OilX, to 10.41 million bpd. While lower than March volumes, the April average was more than 5 percent higher than the April average for 2020, OilX also said, as quoted by EnergyVoice. In March, crude oil imports into China surged to 11.69 million bpd ahead of the start of refinery maintenance season. While considerably higher than the year-ago figure, the March average was lower than the February figure, which stood at 11.73 million bpd.
 The consequent decline as refiners filled up their storage tanks and prepared to begin maintenance operations was expected. In fact, even a further slowdown in imports is on the horizon, according to OilX and others. Higher prices are one reason for the expected slowdown in imports as China has already stocked up on cheap crude and can wait for prices to moderate. Another reason is Beijing’s recently struck massive investment deal with Tehran that many expect will lead to higher imports from the U.S. sanctioned OPEC member, even if the sanctions remain in place.
 Not all agree about the slowdown in imports, however, or at least its length. Energy Voice this week quoted Fitch Solutions as saying it expected imports of crude to China to remain robust. “The outlook for the remainder of the year for Chinese crude demand is bullish,” the ratings agency said. “2021 is expected to see a strong recovery in domestic refining activity and internal, external demand, resulting in an annual growth in crude imports of 11% after Covid-19 restrictions curtailed growth in both in 2020. That said, near-term upside momentum may be slowed in Q2 as maintenance season looms.”  If prices continue to go higher, however, this may have a more durable effect on Chinese crude oil imports this year."
The Only Venue Where Oil Majors Will Still Spend Big.html,"Oil majors may be slashing spending and deferring development plans across the globe, but they remain committed to developing the newest offshore oil finds in the heart of Latin America.   The oil price collapse has forced the world's oil companies to slash spending and curb production at many projects that are uneconomical at the current prices. From Russia and Nigeria to the Permian basin in the United States, companies are scaling back output, either because of the new OPEC+ pact or because of economics.  While production in the U.S. shale plays has started to decline in response to the low oil prices, development plans for the major offshore oil discoveries in Guyana and Suriname remain unchanged, with operators reiterating their pre-crash plans in the Q1 earnings releases. The price crash has upended production plans across the U.S. shale patch, but Guyana and Suriname were spared the ax, as independent energy analyst and consultant David Blackmon writes for Forbes. Long-Term Potential in Offshore Oil Projects These operators continue to view the oil discoveries offshore Guyana and Suriname as high-quality resources that deserve the full attention and financing even as oil prices are sitting below $30 a barrel. Abundant quality offshore resources could pump oil for decades, compared to a year or two of the wells in the U.S. shale patch, which are much cheaper and faster to design, drill, and develop, but which deplete much quicker than large offshore reservoirs.

 Exxon Doubles Down on Guyana's Huge Oil Discoveries  ""Guyana remains an integral part of our long-term growth plans and as such is a high priority,"" Exxon's chairman and chief executive officer Darren Woods said on the call. Operations at Liza Phase 1 have been largely unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic, Exxon said. Thanks to the Liza Phase 1 development, Guyana officially joined the ranks of oil-producing nations at the end of December. Exxon and its partner, Hess Corporation, now believe that the recoverable resource base from 16 oil discoveries offshore Guyana is more than 8 billion oil-equivalent barrels.  Liza Phase 1 continues to ramp up production, which is expected to reach full capacity of 120,000 bpd in June 2020, Exxon said last week. In addition, Liza Phase 2 development is carrying on as planned and remains on schedule for start-up in 2022. Exxon is also working with the Guyana government on the approval of the field development plan (FDP) for another discovery, Paraya, the U.S. supermajor said. ""Unfortunately, the ongoing election process and uncertainty around the next administration has slowed government approvals of the Payara development plan,"" Exxon's Woods said on the earnings call last week. ""The review of the Payara FDP is fairly advanced,"" but talks continue, Mark Bynoe, Director of Guyana's Department of Energy, said this week. The government of Guyana has also just deposited the first royalty payment for Guyana's crude, worth the equivalent of US$4.9 million, into the country's Natural Resources Fund (NRF), with the next deposit expected to be made at end-July.  Related: Investors Skeptical of Big Oil’s Green Plans Guyana's crude is also attracting the largest commodity trading houses and oil majors willing to market the oil to which the government is entitled. As many as 34 firms--including Shell, which lifted Guyana's first oil cargoes; Exxon; and even Aramco Trading--expressed interest in April to market Guyana's share of the oil from the Exxon-operated Liza development, Stabroek News reported last month.  
 Apache Bets on its Major Oil Discoveries Offshore Suriname Guyana's neighbor to the east, Suriname, has also shown great potential for holding considerable offshore oil resources. The companies that are exploring Suriname's waters, Apache Corporation and Total, are also reaffirming their pre-crisis plans for well drilling and appraisal. Arnaud Breuillac, President, Exploration & Production at Total, described the Guyana-Suriname Basin as ""a highly favorable petroleum province,"" when Total entered in December the Block 58 offshore Suriname to partner with Apache. Four months later, Apache and Total had already announced two major oil discoveries that could turn Suriname into an oil producer the same way that significant oil discoveries made its neighbor Guyana the world's newest oil producer. Apache, which vowed discipline and prioritizing investment for long-term returns over production growth, said in its Q1 results release this week that it would advance the exploration program and follow-on appraisal activity in Block 58 offshore Suriname. Apache began drilling its third exploration well in the second half of April, and it will be followed by a fourth exploration well. The corporation will also finalize and submit this quarter the appraisal plan for its first Suriname discovery, Maka, announced in January, while appraisal planning for the second discovery announced in early April is underway, the company said. The reaffirmed commitment to the Guyana-Suriname basin highlights the companies' views that it is a top-quality high-resource area worth developing for long-term returns.   "
Mozambique Delays Could Disrupt Global LNG Market.html,"The global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market, which was set to be constantly loose in the second part of this decade, is instead set to get tighter and could even see annual supply deficits as a result of likely delays in the development of LNG projects in Mozambique due to the country’s worsening security situation, a Rystad Energy report reveals. Mozambique was once poised to catapult into the upper ranks of global LNG producers by the middle of this decade, but Total’s recent force majeure declaration signals indefinite delays on its onshore Mozambique LNG complex. The violent insurgencies also threaten ExxonMobil’s yet-to-be sanctioned Rovuma LNG. Together the two projects represent 28 million tonnes per annum (tpa) of LNG capacity. The market could see up to 9 million tpa of supply removed between 2026 and 2030, disrupting global balances. Rystad Energy had previously forecasted a largely balanced market in 2026, but now there could be more competition for available volumes that year, leading to an upside risk in prices and higher price volatility. Similarly, the loose market conditions of 2027-2028 that we had originally forecasted could become more balanced if Rovuma LNG’s 15.2 million tpa of potential capacity is unavailable. Finally, across 2029 and 2030, the market could tighten again and face supply deficits amid an expected surge in global LNG demand, as Rovuma LNG may only reach plateau production after 2030.  Related: Oil Close To Hitting $70 As The U.S. And Europe Reopen  “The ongoing insurgency in the Cabo Delgado region, while initially seeming manageable, appears to have dented Mozambique’s LNG dreams. We now expect Total’s Mozambique LNG to start production only in 2026, with construction unlikely to resume without demonstrably stronger security arrangements at the Afungi site. Rovuma LNG may be delayed enough to mean it is brought online only around 2029,” says Kaushal Ramesh, LNG analyst in Rystad Energy. In our updated forecast, which accounts for delays in the two projects in Mozambique, we now expect an oversupply of 4 mtpa in 2026, down from our previous forecast for 6.4 mtpa. The impact of the delays will grow in 2027, causing the expected oversupply to shrink to 11 mtpa from previously forecast 15.9 mtpa. The largest downgrade is for 2028, with oversupply being limited to just 1 mtpa, down from 9.3 mtpa in our previous forecast.  Related: Asian LNG Buyers Are Preparing For A Harsh Winter If the expected delays materialize, 2029 will see an LNG supply deficit of 5.6 mpta instead of a previously expected surplus of 2 mtpa. The effect will persist but will start smoothening out from 2030, with an expected supply deficit of 1.7 mtpa instead of a surplus of 1 mtpa. Effect on LNG prices The delays for both Mozambique LNG and Rovuma LNG is sobering news for LNG buyers and sellers alike. Mozambique has a large, low-cost resource base – making its LNG projects highly competitive – and the country is conveniently located to serve upcoming demand in Asia. We estimate DES Asia break-evens of Mozambique’s LNG projects to range between $5 and $7 per MMbtu.
 Mozambique LNG is underpinned by long-term contracts covering more than 85% of its production capacity. Its foundation customers include both end-users and portfolio players. With production now forecasted to commence in 2026, buyers expecting volumes in the tight market years of 2024 and 2025 may need to look for other sources of supply. This is likely to create upward pressure on prices as end-users search for alternative suppliers and portfolio players seek to cover short positions. Those without long-term contract coverage risk having to buy from an increasingly volatile spot market. From the sellers’ perspective, the force majeure notice (potentially even the existing contract terms) may provide respite from delivery obligations until production has begun. Total may also provide volumes from its global portfolio, but such transactions would add a layer of commercial complexity as the Mozambique LNG SPAs are joint SPAs with other Area 1 concessionaries.              Although Rovuma LNG’s project timeline is behind Mozambique LNG, its forecasted delay from 2027 to 2029 is likely to have a larger impact on the market as its production is taken off an increasingly balanced market. This could contribute to greater volatility and higher prices towards the end of this decade. Rystad Energy forecasts a tightening LNG market between now and 2024 as demand continues to grow, driven by new regasification capacity and more gas-power generation, resulting in Asian spot prices reaching $8.5 per MMBtu. With a strong pipeline of liquefaction projects under construction, we previously expected that a new wave of supplies coming into the market around 2025 would create a downward cycle in prices, with the Asian spot price dropping to a level closer to the short-run marginal cost of US LNG of $5.7 per MMBtu in 2027. However, the potential delay of the Mozambican projects means that now there is an increasing risk of a prolonged period of tightness midway through this decade, and that lower prices could be seen one to two years later than previously expected. As a result, Asian spot prices could remain above $8 per MMBtu in 2025. The downside risk in prices between 2026 and 2029 is also reduced by a better-balanced market – while we still expect prices to decline, there is higher likelihood for them to remain above $6 per MMBtu in 2027."
Oil Moves Higher On Largest Crude Draw Since January.html,"Oil prices moved higher after the Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory draw of 8 million barrels for the week to April 30. In fuels, the inventory moves were mixed. The oil inventory figure compared with a weekly draw of 7.688 million barrels estimated by the American Petroleum Institute a day earlier, and with a moderate build of 100,000 barrels that the EIA reported for the previous week. Analysts had expected the EIA to report a crude oil inventory decline of 2.19 million barrels for the period.
 In gasoline, the authority estimated a minor stock build of 700,000 barrels for the last week of April. This compared with another modest build of 100,000 barrels for the previous week. Production last week averaged 9.1 million bpd, which compared with 9.6 million bpd during the previous week. In middle distillates, EIA reported an inventory decline of 2.9 million barrels for the week to April 30. This compares with a draw of 3.3 million barrels for the previous week. Production of middle distillates stood at 4.5 million bpd last week, compared with 4.6 million bpd in the previous week. Related Video: Good Luck Getting Gas This Summer Refineries processed 15.2 million bpd of crude last week, operating at 86.5 percent of capacity as the economy rebounds and boosts oil demand.
 Oil prices are reflecting this trend, as well as expectations that travel will soon pick up thanks to mass vaccinations. The European Union said this week it will seek to start allowing foreign tourists into the block beginning from June in an attempt to avoid a second ruined summer tourist season. In the U.S., states began to relax movement restrictions as the rates of vaccinated people continued up. At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $69.63 per barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at $66.43 per barrel, both up from opening."
OPEC Output Flat Ahead Of Planned 600000 Bpd Boost.html,"OPEC kept its crude oil production essentially flat in April, just before the OPEC+ alliance is set to raise output by 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) in May, a Bloomberg survey showed on Tuesday. The 13 members of OPEC saw their total production at 25.27 million bpd in April, which was around 50,000 bpd lower compared with March, as a reduction in oil supply from Libya, exempted from the cuts, were mostly offset by rising production from another OPEC member exempted from the OPEC+ pact, Iran, the Bloomberg survey found.   Crude oil production from the OPEC+ group is set to grow by over 2 million bpd over the next three months to July.
 In early April, OPEC+ decided to gradually increase collective oil production by 350,000 bpd in each of May and June and by more than 400,000 bpd in July. Additionally, Saudi Arabia will also gradually ease its extra unilateral cut of 1 million bpd over the course of the next few months, beginning with monthly production increases of 250,000 bpd in both May and June. According to the Bloomberg survey, the biggest rises and declines at individual OPEC members in April were seen at two of the oil-producing countries exempted from the pact, Libya and Iran. Libya’s production fell by 80,000 bpd to 1.14 million bpd. Meanwhile, Iran ramped up its output by 60,000 bpd to 2.41 million bpd, as per the Bloomberg survey of ship-tracking data, estimates from consultancies, and information from officials.
 Last week, the monthly Reuters survey showed that OPEC likely raised its oil production in April, driven by another supply increase from Iran. Iran raised its oil production by as much as 200,000 bpd in April compared to March to reach an output of 2.5 million bpd. As a result of Iran’s higher output, the total production of all 13 members of OPEC rose by 100,000 bpd month over month to 25.17 million bpd in April, the Reuters survey showed."
Oil Investment Lags Jump In Crude Prices.html,"Investment in new oil and gas projects last year sank to the lowest in 15 years at $350 billion. As the world continues its battle against Covid-19 and as the energy industry increasingly looks towards diversification outside its core business, it is doubtful how soon—if ever—investments in new upstream projects will recover to pre-pandemic levels. This is not to say there is no sign of recovery in investments. Wood Mackenzie reports there are a total of 26 new projects in conventional oil and gas that could get their final investment decision this year. These projects, the Wood Mac analysts said, would require some $110 billion investments to unlock about 27 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserves. One interesting thing about these projects, which shows the changes that the energy industry is undergoing, is that more than 50 percent of the reserves to be tapped with these projects are natural gas reserves. Many of the largest projects slated for greenlighting this year are in liquefied natural gas, notably Qatar Petroleum’s expansion of production at the North Field. A tenth of the projects awaiting FID this year are deepwater production, and the rest are a mix of offshore and onshore projects. According to Wood Mac, however, there is no guarantee that all these projects will indeed receive a final investment decision. This is due to a variety of reasons, chief among them the expected rate of return, carbon intensity, and the political context. Returns—and the period they will take to make an appearance—have become of the utmost importance for oil and gas investors, and they have also become a top priority for the companies themselves. While before it was usual to pour millions in projects that might not return the investment for decades, the focus is now on shorter return periods, which means short-cycle projects have the best chance for approval.  Related: Russia Boosted Oil Production In April
 LNG projects are not short-cycle ones. LNG facilities require massive upfront investments and take years to generate first returns. There are six large-scale ones due their FID this year, according to Wood Mac. The payback periods for these six projects vary between 10 and 15 years, which casts a shadow over their FIDs. For one thing, as carbon intensity begins to garner more headline space, investors are increasingly paying attention to emissions—and so are buyers. While not standard practice yet, there are signs that carbon-neutral LNG may well be the standard LNG of the future, which means additional investments in carbon capture systems or other ways of reducing the emissions footprint of LNG extraction and production. It remains to be seen whether all planned LNG projects will be greenlit in this context. The carbon issue has become an important one for oil investments, too. The demand outlook has brightened considerably as lockdowns end, and people start traveling again, not to mention the marked preference for personal transportation in the post-lockdown times, which is driving fuel demand higher. Yet so has attention to emissions from oil production. A recent article by Argus on the future of oil investments in the U.S. part of the Gulf of Mexico noted that any plans would need to take into account not just costs but also carbon intensity. Virtually every large energy company now has a low-carbon transition plan of some sort to appease investors, and while they would need money from selling oil to implement these plans, they would also need to be careful about the emissions footprint of this oil’s production.  Related: Three Things That Will Drive Oil Prices In May It is certainly a complex situation for an industry that has become the target of growing criticism and increasingly close scrutiny, both from regulators and from shareholders. Under this twin pressure, many projects—not just this year—could lose their viability because emission reduction could, and often is, a costly undertaking.
 Yet the world will still need oil—and gas—decades from now, and it will need millions of barrels of it daily. This means companies, backed by their shareholders, will continue investing in oil and gas exploration and production. If anything, the energy transition drive would lead to tighter supply for the abovementioned reasons. This tight supply, in turn, will push the prices of these energy commodities higher. And this will drive more investments in oil and gas, emissions and all.  One interesting news story from this week by Bloomberg notes that the rally in oil prices has boosted oil and gas ETFs but also, ironically, ESG funds. That’s due to how ESG funds are constructed, the story explained, but the end result is that people investing in ESG funds are investing part of their money in Big Oil. And when Big Oil does well, so do ESG investors. This might make for some interesting food for thought about ESG investing and oil and gas, and, on a related note, about emission reduction and energy demand and supply. These are the basics that would ultimately prevail, whatever the political context. There is demand for oil and gas, so there needs to be supply, as at least two Big Oil CEOs, of Shell and BP, have recently noted. Until the world needs oil and gas, we will produce oil and gas, they said on separate occasions. And while some of the priorities in making a final investment decision on a new project may have changed, the top priority has remained: will it make money? As long as there’s demand, many projects will make money."
Russia Boosted Oil Production In April.html,"Russia produced 10.46 million bpd last month, up by 1.9 percent on March as OPEC+ relaxed its production cuts, Bloomberg reports, citing data from Russia's Energy Ministry. Russia's production quota had been upped twice before April, by 65,000 bpd in February and March. It was then relaxed by 130,000 bpd for April. From this month to July, Russia will further increase its output by 114,000 bpd, according to Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. OPEC+ in total will increase its oil production by 2 million barrels daily between May and July, signaling its belief in improving demand.
 The production cuts were among the factors that drove Russia's oil exports lower in the first four months of the year, the Energy Ministry said, as quoted by TASS. Shipments of oil abroad declined by 17.2 percent over the four-month period and by 16.4 percent in April alone. Russia's oil production fell from record highs last year for the first time in a decade due to its participation in the OPEC+ pact. Now, according to the Energy Ministry, output may never recover to pre-pandemic levels. It will improve from current levels, the ministry said, reaching 11.1 million bpd by 2029 but then starting to decline, reaching 9.4 million bpd by 2035. Because of these projections, Russia needs to monetize its oil wealth while it can, or, as the head of the energy committee at the Russian parliament put it earlier this year, ""Everything that can be produced should be produced while there is still demand to sell it.""
 This is the base-case or most likely scenario developed by the Energy Ministry. In its best-case scenario, the ministry sees Russia's oil production hit a peak of 12.8 million bpd by 2030 and only then begin to decline. In either scenario, a steady decline in output is imminent."
Africas Most Interesting Untapped Oil Play.html,"When writing the article on this year’s Top Oil Wildcats, one of the hottest candidates had to be dropped out of the list. Not because the prospect turned out to be sub-commercial, far from it, it remains one of Africa’s most interesting untapped plays, potentially opening up a new country with no previous exposure to the world of energy. As Senegal and Mauritania started to break their way onto the energy maps of Western Africa, Guinea Bissau has remained a relative outlier. At the same time it needs to be pointed out that lack of officially recognized discoveries does not necessarily mean lack of hydrocarbons, as can be attested by the Atum prospect. Atum remains one of the hottest plays in offshore Africa, an overlooked gem that would only need a little bit of political stability to shine.  Recent big discoveries in Senegal’s offshore, such as FAN-1 and SNE (the latter being the largest oil discovery globally in 2014), shortly thereafter followed by new plays in Mauritania’s offshore such as Orca, have unearthed an untapped frontier area that is rich in both oil and gas. Over the past decade Mauritania and Senegal have advanced quite well in terms of appraising their offshore territory, however the southern flank of the MSGBC Basin (short for Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Guinea-Conakry) has been lagging behind. The root causes of this are institutional, although Guinea Bissau adopted a new Petroleum Law in 2014, its implementation was never really tested in real life. In countries where peaceful handover of power is still a questionable concept, the anticipation of hydrocarbon discoveries to come, coupled with a heightened sense of political infighting, has created a cumbersome challenge.   Related: U.S. Rig Count Increases To 440 Rigs The hydrocarbon story of Guinea Bissau is a fairly standard one for a small West African nation.
 The tiny country has no commercial discoveries up to date, with official 2P reserves estimated at 12-13 million barrels (equivalent to the Sinapa oil discovery within Block 02). The last offshore wildcat that Bissau had seen dates back to 2007 when the UK-based firm Premier Oil spudded the Eirozes-1 well in the Esperança block. Drilled into a total depth of 2250 metres in water depth of 100 metres, the well turned out to be dry. This failure has prompted Premier Oil to leave Guinea Bissau’s offshore in December 2007 – thereafter Svenska Petroleum assumed operatorship over the block. Whilst the Atum prospect, located farther out in deeper waters, has been known for quite some time already, financial issues of license-holding firms and the general lack of appetite for genuine frontier drilling has kept the ambition down.  The Atum prospect is located in the westernmost part of Block 02, partially spilling over into Block 04. It is abutted from the left by the Anchova prospect and from the right by the Sardinha prospect (you have guessed it right, the fishy concept extends to Atum, too, the name of the blocks means “tuna”). What is new about the Atum prospect? First and foremost, Atum is assumed to become Guinea Bissau’s first-ever deepwater well. Second, Atum is an analogue of Senegal’s SNE-1: it, too, is a shelf-edge play, in similar water depths (900 metres vs 1100 metres) and targeting the same Upper Albian deposits. The unrisked prospective resources of Atum are assessed at 471 MMbbls, i.e. very similar to those of SNE (563 MMbbls). Should the prospective drillers also aim for the Anchova prospect next to Atum, the combined reserves total would increase to 568MMbbls.  Related: Three Things That Will Drive Oil Prices In May Atum has up to now suffered from one main deficiency – lack of a financially robust oil major. Throughout the 2010s, the Swedish Svenska Petroleum was seeking to farm out interests in Blocks 02 and 04A to fund its ambitious drilling plans. Struggling to go at it completely alone, Svenska reached an agreement in August 2019 with the Chinese CNOOC. CNOOC was to purchase 55.55% of the Sinapa and Esperança license blocks (i.e. Block 2 and Blocks 4A/5A) for the duration of the exploration phase, to be converted into a regular 50% participating interest should the project be deemed commercially viable. The transaction was assumed to be concluded at some point in Q3 2019, once all the authorities of Guinea Bissau provide all regulatory approvals – needless to say, at that point (just as now) Block 02 was the most promising offshore play that Bissau had. Upon receiving all required approvals, drilling the Atum prospect in Block 02 was supposed to take place in Q1 2020, an ambition that never materialized. 
 Domestic political turmoil is also one of the main reasons underlying Guinea Bissau’s inability to move swiftly enough on regulatory approvals. For a brief period in early 2020 the West African nation had two presidents simultaneously, pitting the camp of Umaro Embaló, the winner of the presidential elections, and Domingos Simoes who refused to acknowledge the results of the ballot and had Cipriano Cassama elected as interim president. It was the President that was bound to approve CNOOC’s farm-in into Block 02 of Guinea Bissau’s offshore and with both parties fully focused on tripping up political opponents rather than kickstarting the country’s oil and gas sector, the end result was worse than anybody could have forethought.  Against this background, not only did CNOOC quit the intended deal, Svenska Petroleum sold all of its Guinea Bissau acreage (78.57% in Blocks 02, 04A and 05A) to the Norwegian PetroNor in November 2020. It seems likely that PetroNor, joined by the embattled Australian company FAR (21.42% interest), would also prefer to have a go at Atum with a heavy-hitting partner. The acreage license covering exploration works in Block 02 was extended by further 3 years into 2023, therefore the road is clear for interested parties. With this, the spudding of the Atum-1 wildcat is most likely to take place in 2022. "
Canada Is Battling Another Pipeline Cancelation By The US.html,"President Biden is coming under fire for his attack on oil and gas once again as Canada pleads to keep the cross-border Great Lakes oil pipeline open.  Canada is battling against the state of Michigan to keep the cross-border pipeline open as calls to enhance the joint response to climate change seem to be at odds with the two countries’ oil industries. To create meaningful policy change towards clean energy the U.S. and Canada must work together to support their oil and gas sectors while establishing a clear strategy for the eventual movement away from fossil fuels.  It is important to remember that the U.S. relies heavily on Canada for much of its crude oil imports, consuming around 3.7 million barrels per day, or about 80 percent of Canada's crude output. Line 5 is supposed to close by May 13, according to Michigan’s governor, to eliminate the risk of a major leak. As much as 540,000-bpd oil and natural gas liquids pass through this line, making it essential for oil transportation between the two countries. However, the 70-year-old pipeline presents an extreme environmental risk due to its age.  The pipeline currently provides energy to Michigan, Ontario and Quebec, to an area of around 40 million people, meaning the disruption caused by this closure would be significant. This is the second major pipeline that has prompted a dispute between the U.S. and Canada since President Biden came to office earlier this year. The first was the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline project in January. The pipeline was expected to transport 800,000 bpd of crude between Alberta and refineries in the U.S.
  Related: Three Things That Will Drive Oil Prices In May Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed disappointment in this decision and Alberta Premier Jason Kenney called the decision a “gut punch” and an “insult”; threatening legal action to recover the $1.5 billion investment by Alberta for the project. A significant proportion of jobs were lost in relation to the cancellation of Keystone, and the closing of line 5 threatens Canada’s oil and gas industry further.  Officials from both sides have been formally discussing the potential decommissioning of the pipeline for months, mostly in joint conversations over climate change and policy cohesion. Yet Canada seems to have received little response on the matter from the White House to date.  If deemed necessary, Ottawa could go so far as to invoke the 1977 Transit Pipelines Treaty to stop the closure that would hinder the transit of Canadian oil. This would be the first case of this treaty being enacted.
 Canadian Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan stated, “We have signaled very clearly that this is nonnegotiable,” In addition, “Line 5 is very different from Keystone XL and we fully support it, and we will defend it,” he said. “We made our case with Republicans as well as Democrats.” Canadian Enbridge Inc. is instead suggesting that the infrastructure be updated to mitigate the potential for an oil spill by building a tunnel under Lake Michigan. The tunnel, Enbridge claims, would make vital oil transportation infrastructure safer, in line with Biden’s energy policy idea of ‘Build Back Better’. Enbridge is also criticising Michigan’s move as it will imply the need for thousands of long-haul vehicles to transport the oil that currently flows through the pipeline. If the pipeline closure goes ahead it will have a detrimental effect on Canada’s oil and gas industry, which has already taken a hit from the cancellation of Keystone. It will also imply the halting of vital oil and gas imports to the American market. The question is whether Biden will respond to Enbridge’s counter proposal to invest in the existing infrastructure to mitigate the risk of a spill without hindering oil transportation between the two countries."
What Will Privatization Mean For Indias Burgeoning Oil Industry.html,"Indian state-owned oil and gas producer Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) is told to sell its stake in the country’s oil fields as part of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas seven-point plan to boost production after a year of limited production.  According to a Press Trust of India (PTI) report the country’s Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is communicating with ONGC on how to increase oil output over the coming years.  The plan, titled 'ONGC Way Forward', suggests that ONGC divests its stake in several onshore and offshore oil fields, including Panna-Mukta or Ratna, R-Series and the Gandhar field, as well as partnering with foreign oil and gas firms to develop its projects in the gas-rich block KG-DWN-98/2, Ashokenagar block in West Bengal and Deendayal block in the KG basin. The Ministry is also putting pressure on the ONGC to monetise existing infrastructure. Production in the $5-billion KG-DWN-98/2 project is expected to increase substantially over the next year, with peak production projected for 2024. ONGC expects the fields to support around 2 million metric standard cubic metres per day (MMSCMD) of natural gas by the end of June. Additional fields operated by Reliance and British Petroleum in the Krishna Godavari basin will contribute to the increase in domestic natural gas production.  The plan also looks to separate various oil services such as drilling, well services, logging, workover services and data processing entities.
  Related: Goldman: Oil To Hit $80 On Largest Ever Demand Jump Efforts are being made to increase national oil and gas production as ONGC crude production fell from 20.6 million tonnes at the end of fiscal year 2020 to 20.2 million tonnes in 2021. Gas production also decreased during the same time period. The plan hopes to see ONGC increase production levels by one-third by 2024.  This plan represents the third attempt under the Modi government at convincing ONGC to privatise its marginal oil and gas fields to focus wholly on large producing fields to boost domestic production. The plan states that national production must increase production to 40 million tonnes of crude oil and 50 billion cubic metres of natural gas by fiscal year 2023-24 if India hopes to reduce its dependence on oil and gas imports and meet domestic needs. ONGC is expected to produce the majority of this target oil production, at around 70 percent of the country’s total oil and gas output, an increase of almost 8 million tonnes of crude on its present production levels. 
 An official stated of the plan, “India’s domestic crude oil production is constantly on a decline. It is mainly because ONGC, which contributes about 70% of the domestic output, is unable to ramp up production from existing fields and could not add new fields under production. Hence, the action plan”. However, industry experts believe the plan could significantly weaken ONGC, with private partners profiting from the corporation’s existing discoveries in oil and gas, likely the reason that ONGC has, until now, resisted pressure from the Ministry to divide its assets and privatise.  Yet, with India’s oil and gas production levels falling under ONGC since 2012, largely due to the reliance on low-output aging wells, it is clear that something must be done if the government hopes to increase domestic production levels. For example, boosting national production will likely require technologically intensive methods to benefit from more hard-to-access areas such as ultradeepwater fields, something ONGC is currently failing to achieve.  While ONGC will likely resist the Oil Ministry’s latest attempt at privatisation, it has become clear that the state-owned corporation must adapt in order to meet national oil and gas needs over the next decade. "
Canadas Oil Patch Is Preparing For A Production Hike.html,"At a time when U.S. shale, OPEC+, and dozens of oil producers have laid out blueprints to limit production in a bid to return the global oil industry to its former glory, Canada’s Oil Patch appears to be merely paying lip service to the notion of keeping production subdued.  Like everybody else, Canada’s oil and gas producers have been preaching capital discipline and assuring investors they have no intention of boosting spending, preferring to return capital to investors mainly in the form of dividends and buybacks. But behind the scenes, Canada’s Oil Patch has been giving a nod and a wink to supply chain partners, telling oilfield services companies to get ready for prime-time action—and soon. A survey by investment bank Raymond James has revealed that the majority of Canada’s mid-and small-cap oil and gas producers plan to increase their capital expenditure (Capex) this year by a significant margin. More drilling About 51% of oil and gas producers intend to ramp-up production over the coming months if oil prices remain above $60 per barrel with a good 28% of E&P companies saying they have increased their budgets by at least 25%.  Source: Financial Post So, where will this extra money be going? More drilling, apparently. In a separate survey, Raymond James says that a staggering 87% of oilfield services companies--comprising drilling, fracking, and construction companies--expect demand for their services to increase this year compared to a year ago.  Related: Can Big Oil Lure Investors Back?
 But as Raymond James notes, production ramps by smaller Canadian players are unlikely to upset the delicate balance in the global oil markets. A couple of days ago, OPEC said it expects global oil demand to bounce back to the tune of 6 million barrels per day in the current year, thanks to economic recovery by key consumers such as the United States, China, and the UK. Canada’s smaller oil and gas companies will also be hunting for M&A deals. A good 55% of respondents said they are either ‘likely’ or ‘highly likely’ to engage in M&A activity over the next six months. That’s hardly surprising given how Canada’s oil patch has been turning to mergers as conditions there get increasingly dire. Wave of Consolidations A vicious one-two-three punch that started with a gloomy long-term future outlook due to rampant fossil fuel divestments, climate change policies, and decarbonization as well as shorter-term, but severe shocks from the COVID-19 crisis, has thrown Canada’s most important exports industry into an existential crisis.  Meanwhile, the drumbeat of exits by foreign oil firms bailing on the unprofitable tar sands has added an extra layer of gloom for an industry that’s responsible for a fifth of Canada’s exports. It, therefore, comes as little surprise that Canada’s oil and gas producers are scrambling to merge as they hope to survive to see another oil boom. A wave of consolidation has hit Canada’s Montney oil and gas region as smaller companies sell their assets to other firms. Straddling northeast British Columbia and northwest Alberta, the Montney is one of Canada’s leading shale oil epicenters, producing 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 45% of Western Canada’s gas supply.  Related: Goldman: Oil To Hit $80 On Largest Ever Demand Jump Faced with a six-year oil downturn, many smaller, debt-ridden oil and gas producers have been giving up the wait for a rebound and resorting to mergers in a bid to survive. 
 They have little recourse: Just like their shale counterparts further south, Canada’s oil industry has seen once-prolific credit lines dry up as the value of their reserves rapidly dwindle during the prolonged crisis. Eighteen Canadian companies tracked by Wood Mackenzie saw the amount of their reserve-based loans shrivel by some C$1.8 billion, or 22% in 2020. Consequently, the Montney region recorded at least nine significant deals worth some C$2.3 billion ($1.75 billion) last year. Two of the largest deals were the acquisition of acreage by U.S. major ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) from Kelt Exploration (TSE:KEL) for $325 million, as well as Canadian Natural Resources Limited’s (NYSE:CNQ) purchase of Painted Pony Energy in a $461 million deal. It’s worth noting that CNQ assumed Painted Pony’s total debt of approximately $350 million upon the purchase. Companies operating in Canada’s natural gas sector have not been faring much better amidst the historic price crash. One of the Montney’s earliest gas drillers, Advantage Oil and Gas (TSE:AAV), sold a stake in its Glacier gas plant in July for C$100 million ($75.7M) in a bid to raise cash for operations but says it remains open to a complete merger. Private equity bargain hunting Dozens of companies in the Canadian Oil Patch, such as Bow Energy Ltd. (CVE:ONG) and Cequence Energy Ltd (TSX:CQE) filed for bankruptcy protection or opted to restructure. Others like Obsidian Energy Ltd. (OTCMKTS: OBELF), however, are going off the beaten path--by putting themselves up for purchase by private equity (PE) firms. PE firms like Waterous Energy Fund have turned into trophy hunters, buying up distressed assets at dirt-cheap valuations. A good case in point is last year’s purchase of Pengrowth Energy Corp. for $740-million by Waterous’ subsidiary Cona Resources, representing less than a fifth of its more than $4B valuation at the time of the deal. Massive discounts have pretty much become par for the course in Canada’s M&A space: A total of 23 such deals have been consummated in the year-to-date for an underwhelming total of  $1.65 billion compared to $15.47 billion deal value from 42 M&A deals completed during last year’s corresponding period. Waterous is a master of the game, having amalgamated six small producers from different deals into a giant it has dubbed Strathcona Resources Ltd., easily one of North America’s largest private-equity owned drillers with a daily production clip exceeding 60,000 barrels. According to Waterous CEO Adam Waterous, there has never been a greater need for consolidation in Canada’s energy sector, noting that small oil and gas companies have been locked out of debt and equity markets, effectively leaving them orphaned. Waterous says these orphaned businesses need to come together if they are to survive the onslaught, which he does not see ending any time soon. That said, it is worth noting that Canada’s bigger oil companies have been holding up pretty well, with the likes of Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU), Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE), Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (NYSE:CNQ), and Husky Energy Inc. (TSE:HSE) having little trouble tapping debt markets."
The Great Car Comeback Brightens Oil Demand Outlook.html,"Despite high vaccination rates in many parts of the world, people appear to be still wary of public transit, opting for personal vehicles, which is driving up demand for crude oil along with metals. Called “the great car comeback” by Bloomberg, the trend is visible in locations as diverse as Tel Aviv, Moscow, and Bucharest, according to data from satellite navigation device maker TomTom. Car sales in Europe soared by 63 percent last month to 1.39 million, which was high not just compared to last year, when sales of everything but handwash and toilet paper were subdued. The March registrations number was the highest monthly car sales figure since June 2019, Bloomberg noted in an earlier report.
 Car sales rose in the first quarter, at double-digit rates. Electric cars—including plug-in hybrids—also increased strongly but constituted just 15 percent of total quarterly sales. This means gasoline cars are still the preferred option for many drivers, hence the good news for oil demand. But the news is not so good for city dwellers, according to the more recent Bloomberg report. The great car comeback could be here to stay as one of the lasting effects of the pandemics on our lifestyle. This would mean heavier traffic jams in already congested cities, and longer commutes for those who will still be working from an office. Before that, however, people will be traveling for pleasure. “People have a lot of cash in their pockets, and as lockdowns ease places will open up and allow those kind of leisure trips that may have been blocked,” one of the founders of Energy Aspects, Richard Bronze, told Bloomberg.
 All this may change in the longer term as governments plan or mull over bans on gasoline cars. For now, however, gasoline is having a golden era."
When Will Oil Demand Fully Recover.html,"As the Covid-19 pandemic began to spread last year, I developed an idea. I hypothesized that the pandemic would cause a permanent dent in oil demand. I covered that hypothesis in a couple of articles last year, including Will Covid-19 Hasten The Demise Of Fossil Fuels? My reasoning was that the large scale move to telework would prove to be very popular, and some companies would simply continue to business that way. Meetings that required people to fly halfway across the country could easily be done by teleconferencing. Once people were forced to adapt to this, they would embrace the advantages and the potential costs savings. I have participated in many such meetings over the past year, and the convenience vastly trumps the travel required to meet in person. Before the pandemic it seems like most interviews for television broadcast were done in person in the studio. Now, most interviews are done via Skype or some other teleconferencing application. We accept that as perfectly normal now. Don’t get me wrong. There are still advantages to meeting in person. Even as oil demand plunged last year, I did expect a significant rebound as the economy began to open up. I just didn’t expect it to rebound to pre-pandemic levels for at least a few years.
 But I have noticed that over the past two months my daily commute has gotten steadily worse. I hadn’t checked gasoline demand in a while, but I was guessing that it had rebounded to something close to pre-pandemic levels. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), for the week ending 4/16/21 U.S. gasoline demand was 9.1 million barrels per day (BPD). That is 71% higher than demand in the same week last year, and only about 3% lower than average mid-April demand from 2017 to 2019. The weekly average for total petroleum demand has exceeded 20 million BPD four times since February. That’s within 5% of pre-pandemic demand.  Related: Goldman: Oil To Hit $80 On Largest Ever Demand Jump Demand for jet fuel has also bounced back. In the most recent issue of This Week in Petroleum, the EIA reported on the return of air travel: “In February 2020, just before responses to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in substantial reductions in air travel, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) processed an average of 2.2 million air passengers per day. In April 2020, however, when the impact on air travel was at its highest, TSA passenger throughput fell to 0.1 million passengers per day. TSA passenger throughput increased gradually from April through July 2020, but from August 2020 through February 2021, passenger throughput was relatively flat, remaining between 0.7 million passengers per day and 0.9 million passengers per day. In March 2021, average daily TSA passenger throughput reached 1.2 million, the highest monthly average throughput since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Passenger throughput in April 2021 has continued to increase, rising to an average of 1.4 million passengers per day as of April 20.”
 The EIA showed steady growth in jet fuel demand following last year’s plunge, and they projected demand will return to normal by the second half of next year. Thus far, my hypothesis has held up. Travel hasn’t yet returned to normal. My commute is getting worse, but traffic still isn’t quite as bad as it was before the pandemic. Still, I think it’s premature to argue that peak oil demand has arrived. There may be a permanent impact due to more telework, but it seems inevitable that the rising global population will ultimately lead to new oil consumption records. It just probably won’t happen as quickly as it would have because of the pandemic’s impact."
Rystad Energy Indias COVID Crisis Could Result In Global Oil Glut.html,"India’s worsening COVID outbreak is set to disturb the nearly balanced global oil market, which will show a surplus of oil supply of as much as 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) next month amid a sizeable loss of demand from the world’s third-largest oil importer, Rystad Energy says. India has seen fuel demand decline in recent weeks as record-high new coronavirus infections are prompting lockdowns and curfews in many states in the country of 1.3 billion residents, limiting mobility and slowing business activity. India’s combined demand for diesel, the most used fuel in the country, and for gasoline is set to plunge by as much as 20 percent in April compared to March, officials from refiners and fuel retailers told Bloomberg. Demand is further expected to decline in the coming weeks as curfews and localized lockdowns are likely to be extended.
 The enormous health crisis in a major oil importer and consumer such as India has prompted Rystad Energy to significantly revise down its short-term estimate of global oil liquids demand. India’s crisis is expected to slash 575,000 bpd of oil demand in April and as much as 915,000 bpd in May, “disturbing the almost-balanced global oil market and building a sizeable glut,” the energy research firm said. The surplus on the global oil market is seen at 900,000 bpd this month and at 1.4 million bpd next month, according to Rystad Energy. India’s demand decline coincides with OPEC+ starting to bring additional supply to the market as of May 1. In a shortened and fast meeting earlier this week, the alliance didn’t change its decision to start raising output, signaling confidence in oil demand recovery elsewhere despite the surging COVID cases in India.
 While Rystad Energy sees a glut coming, Goldman Sachs continues to believe that the market will take India’s crisis in its stride and will realize the biggest jump ever over the next six months. Goldman Sachs continues to see oil rising to $80 per barrel this summer and says that “The magnitude of the coming change in the volume of demand -- a change which supply cannot match -- must not be understated.”"
India COVID Crisis Could Slow Global Oil Demand Rebound.html,"India’s grim record-setting COVID wave shows the market that the expected rebound in global oil demand this year may not be a straight line up. The world’s third-largest oil importer has seen fuel demand decline in recent weeks as record-high new coronavirus infections prompt lockdowns and curfews in many states in the country of 1.3 billion residents, limiting mobility and slowing business activity. India’s demand for diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel is expected to further decline in the coming weeks, with no sign that the health crisis will be brought under control anytime soon. Indian crude oil imports—at around 4.6 million barrels per day (bpd)—are still holding steady, but they could start dropping later this quarter and at the beginning of the third quarter, undermining the recovery in oil demand led by the U.S. and China, analysts say.   The recovery in Indian fuel demand earlier this year gave oil bulls hope that the OPEC+ decision from April 1 to ease the group’s production cuts by over 1 million bpd over May-July is the right call for bringing balance to an increasingly tight oil market this summer. But the latest fuel demand data from India suggest that the ‘strong oil demand rebound’ narrative could have undermined the impact of the second wave in one of the most important oil markets in the world. The impact of India’s COVID resurgence is unlikely to be as devastating as last year’s 60-percent crash in fuel demand amid a nationwide lockdown. This year, no country-wide lockdown has been declared, although many states and major cities have imposed restrictions.
 But those limits on mobility were immediately felt in India’s demand for fuel. The recovery from last year’s lockdown was attributed mostly to Indians preferring driving their own vehicles—almost all running on diesel and gasoline—to using public transportation. With mobility now restricted again, consumption of diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel is falling. India’s combined demand for diesel, the most used fuel in the country, and for gasoline is set to plunge by as much as 20 percent in April compared to March, officials from refiners and fuel retailers told Bloomberg. Refiners in India have already cut capacity utilization to 94-95 percent from 100 percent as the lockdowns lead to fewer sales of gasoline and diesel. “We have cut the capacity marginally at present and are observing the situation. In case the cases continue to rise, and states extend lockdowns and curfews, we will have to review the situation,” a senior official with an oil marketing firm told Mint this week. “Refining and marketing companies are cutting down on capacity utilisation although the demand slowdown is not as severe as April 2020,” Sabyasachi Majumdar, Group Head & Senior Vice President at investment information and credit rating agency ICRA, said on Monday. The lockdowns in recent weeks have already dampened sales of auto fuels and jet fuel, ICRA said, not ruling out the possibility of consumption worsening going forward.  
 Business activity in India is also suffering from the COVID wave. According to brokerage Nomura, cited by The Economic Times, business activity saw in the week to April 25 its steepest weekly decline in more than a year.  This marked slowdown in activity and fuel consumption has not yet translated into significantly lower crude oil imports.   “India’s crude oil imports are so far keeping pace with seasonal norms but a fresh surge in coronavirus cases prompting new lockdowns could hit fuel demand and temper crude buying,” Fotios Katsoulas, Liquid Bulk Principal Analyst, Maritime & Trade at IHS Markit, wrote last week. According to Refinitiv Oil Research, cited by Reuters, India’s crude imports in April would be around 3.59 million bpd, down from 4.22 million bpd in March. The lower imports in April would be the result of India’s frustration with OPEC+ decisions about what India says are “artificial cuts to keep the price going up.” Arrivals in April must have been contracted in February when oil prices were rising. However, if India’s COVID surge is not brought under control soon, the country’s oil imports in June and July could further drop, not only because of oil above $65, but also because fuel demand is set for at least a few more weeks of declines. While apprehensive about India’s near-term demand, the market, as well as OPEC+, seem confident that the expected oil consumption rebound in the U.S., China, and parts of Europe would offset the slowdown in India."
Three Things That Will Drive Oil Prices In May.html,"The Energy Sector (NYSEARCA:XLE) has taken the lead in the S&P midday sector standings on Wednesday trading, jumping 3.5% as OPEC+ appears ready to stick with earlier plans to slightly increase oil production from May 1. The OPEC technical committee has issued a bullish oil demand forecast, although a hawkish tone by the Fed could derail the recent oil price gains. Meanwhile, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is scheduled to take place on 27-28 April 2021, with the committee set to announce any changes to its monetary policy immediately after.  Another big catalyst: Covid-19, which continues being a big wildcard that's confounding bulls and bears alike. On the one hand, one of the fastest Covid-19 vaccination campaigns has enabled the United States to rapidly ease lockdown measures and add serious momentum to the world's largest economy. On the other hand, analysts have warned that a worrying outbreak of coronavirus in India, the world's third largest oil importer, along with resurgence of cases in Japan and Brazil, could seriously dent oil demand.  Here are three scenarios that could determine the oil trajectory in May. #1. OPEC Meeting: Strong oil Demand OPEC+ has ditched plans to hold a full ministerial meeting on Wednesday and instead plans to gather in early June after a technical meeting on Tuesday voiced concerns about surging Covid-19 cases. The good news: The technical committee has forecast global oil consumption to rebound by 6M bbl/day this year, according to delegates who attended the panel. Related Video: Oil on Guard over Yemen as Saudi, Iran Meet in Secret 
 The optimism is mainly being driven by the United States, where a demand recovery is seen outpacing much of the world while China's oil demand has even managed to surpass pre-pandemic levels according to BP Plc (NYSE:BP) Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney. Will a confirmation of that position on Wednesday be enough to drive another big oil price rally?  Probably not. Whereas OPEC+ decision to skip the ministerial meeting suggests that the organization is happy with where the markets are right now, a lot of that optimism is already heavily priced in, according to Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp.  More worrying is the fact that the report by the technical committee was not exactly glowing, with the committee warning that a serious Covid-19 resurgence could throw a monkey wrench into the expected recovery. The oil markets, though, could still realize significant gains given that crude prices remain below their recent highs. #2. FOMC Meeting: Economic Inflection Point  Source: Financial Times Since Fed officials last convened in March, evidence has been growing that the U.S. economy is on much stronger footing than at the beginning of the year. In fact, Fed chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that the U.S. economy is at an ""inflection point.""
 There's little doubt that U.S. economic data is now printing some pretty impressive numbers. The U.S. labor market has staged a strong rebound from the pandemic lows while the New Durable Goods Orders confirmed a serious increase in new orders, thus affirming that economic growth is accelerating.  That said, experts feel that FOMC will be careful to avoid painting an overly optimistic picture by overstating the improvements. It will have to be confident that economic growth is picking up in a way that it can eliminate the labor market slack and maybe even add a bit to inflation.  Related: Can Big Oil Lure Investors Back? Vincent Reinhart, a former Fed economist who now serves as chief economist at Mellon, says it might be too early for the Fed to even start considering cutting its $120-billion-a-month bond purchases, given that the unemployment rate remains high at 6% while the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index remains in check at 1.4%. Economists at Goldman Sachs reckon the Fed will avoid taper talk until the second half of the current year and won't start actual tapering till early 2022--a positive for the oil and gold markets. That said, Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies, has warned that a very strong job report—with 1m or more jobs added a month—could accelerate this timeline, with initial tapering discussions starting as early as June. #3. Covid-19 Wildcard The global pandemic remains, by far, the biggest wildcard in the long-term oil price outlook. The trends have been really encouraging in the U.S.,UK, and China; Mixed in Europe with coronavirus restrictions easing in some countries while others remain hesitant to take any bold actions but very worrying in India, Brazil and Japan where OPEC+ says a resurgence could wipe out 350K barrels per day in global oil demand. As things stand now, however, there's optimism that other countries will avoid slipping into India's dire situation. At least nine countries, including U.S., UK, China, Australia, Germany, and Pakistan among others have pledged to help India overcome its tragic humanitarian crisis by sending much-needed medical equipment, vaccines, oxygen, vaccines, and treatments. Hopefully, other countries will learn from India and avoid relaxing restrictions too soon."
Oil Theft Is A Major Problem In Latin America.html,"Washington’s focus on disrupting narco-trafficking in Latin America, through a combination of coca crop eradication, enforcement and seizures is placing pressure on criminal organizations to find other sources of income. This has seen criminal organizations and non-state armed groups at all levels across the region move to generate much-needed revenue from less hazardous ventures.  One illicit activity, which has exploded in popularity in Latin America since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic is the theft of crude oil and derivative products such as gasoline. The pandemic has exacerbated many of the structural weaknesses that exist in the region, notably fiscally weak governments, entrenched poverty, ingrained inequality and high degrees of lawlessness. That has precipitated a sharp increase in crime across Latin America, which many regional governments are struggling to contain. The proliferation of oil theft is aided by pipelines passing through remote terrain making them easily accessible, the view is that it is a victimless crime and the fact that it is less risky to profitably dispose of petroleum than illegal substances such as cocaine. Colombia has experienced a sharp uptick in the volume of petroleum theft since the pandemic began. Toward the end of September 2020 Colombia’s national oil company Ecopetrol stated it had found almost 900 illegal valves on pipelines during the first eight months of the year compared to 747 for the same period a year earlier. The national oil company estimated around 2,500 barrels per day of oil and derivative products were being stolen. In January 2021 Ecopetrol announced that during 2020 crude oil theft had surged by a worrying 46% year over year to 2,638 barrels per day. Most of that petroleum was stolen from the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, a frequent target for sabotage by leftist guerillas including the National Liberation Army (ELN – Spanish initials) which has also been linked to crude oil theft and trafficking. Based on a 2020 average Brent price of $41.96 per barrel that equates to around $40 million or 0.02% of 2020 gross domestic product, although the proceeds are likely considerably lower with the oil stolen being sold at a deep discount to market prices.  Related Video: Oil on Guard over Yemen as Saudi, Iran Meet in Secret
  Colombia is experiencing a security crisis, precipitated by the pandemic and a weak state presence in many regional areas, which is impacting oil industry operations including exploration activity and potentially production volumes. Violence is rising as evidenced by the increased number of massacres and murders of community leaders as well as activists, especially in rural regions. There has also been a notable increase in oilfield invasions, which since peace negotiations with the FARC commenced in 2012 have been rare events. When those factors are combined with Colombia’s long-history of lawlessness and violence, a renewed crackdown on cocaine trafficking and the failed implementation of the 2016 FARC peace agreement, it is likely that the theft of crude oil will continue to rise. Colombia’s national police claim (Spanish) that over a third of all crude oil stolen in the Andean nation ends up in Venezuela. The near-failed Latin American state is an ideal location to dispose of illegally acquired petroleum. Venezuela shares a highly porous border with Colombia, while Caracas exerts little control over territory outside of the major cities, making it easy to transport illicit cargoes between the countries. The petrostate’s large but deteriorating petroleum industry and high levels of corruption, combined with a notable increase in the dark voyages of oil cargoes since Washington ratcheted up sanctions in 2019, makes it easy to sell crude oil regardless of its origin. It is not only Colombia which has been impacted by a sharp increase in oil theft. Argentina experienced petroleum theft on a never seen before scale during 2020. A sophisticated scheme (Spanish) was uncovered by authorities where an organized group had tapped the 325,000 barrel per day Rosales-La Plata pipeline operated by national oil company YPF. The pipeline, which carries light sweet Medanito and heavy sweet Escalante crude oil grades, connects the Port of Rosales to YPF’s La Plata refinery. The volume of crude oil siphoned from the pipeline was not announced but Argentina’s federal police arrested 21 suspects, including YPF employees, and found a YPF cistern containing 20,000 liters of crude oil. This, however, was a rare event for Argentina with the country not previously having experienced large scale petroleum theft like Venezuela, Colombia or Mexico.  Related: The Ugly Truth About Renewable Power Theft of petroleum and gasoline soared in Brazil where a deep recession before the pandemic triggered a spike in illicit activities. According to news agency Reuters, theft from Petrobras pipelines in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo during 2018 surged to 261 incidents compared to a single case in 2014. During June 2020 former Petrobras CEO Roberto Castello Branco stated that oil theft was costing Petrobras’ logistics business Transpetro more than $28 million annually. Incidents of theft are reportedly falling because of a crackdown by Brazilian authorities and Petrobras. 
 Those numbers pale into insignificance compared to Mexico, where the robbery  of crude oil and fuels which began in the 1990s has become a highly organized and lucrative activity. It is estimated that the theft of petroleum and refined products costs Mexico’s national oil company Pemex a stunning $3 billion annually. A crackdown by President Lopez Obrador, who took office in December 2018, has seen the volume of stolen crude oil plunge significantly over recent months. Official data shows (Spanish) there has been a sharp decline in the volume of crude oil and derivative product theft in Mexico over the last two years. By December 2020, the theft of petroleum products from Pemex had fallen to 5,640 barrels daily compared to a whopping 74,000 barrels per day at the end of December 2018. The theft of crude oil and derivative products is a significant problem for the oil industry in many Latin American countries, notably Colombia where the incidence is rapidly rising, and Mexico. While the war on drugs and violent offences are a top regional priority for Washington and regional governments, the theft of petroleum is a low priority crime which has been placed on the backburner in many jurisdictions. Not only is it perceived to be a victimless and non-violent crime but declining fiscal income across Latin America because of the pandemic’s economic fallout is forcing governments to prioritize spending and distribution of hard-pressed security resources. That means already thinly stretched and underfunded regional law enforcement agencies are focusing on containing high impact crimes linked to significant violence such as narco-trafficking. The near collapse of the Venezuelan state is further destabilizing Latin America and amplifying the conditions which are allowing petroleum and gasoline theft as well as trafficking to thrive in the region. A long history of regional lawlessness and weak states combined with rising regional poverty due to the pandemic means it will remain a key risk for Latin America’s oil industry for some time to come despite recent crackdowns."
Oil Prices Rally Despite Bearish Backlash.html,"Despite the re-emerging Covid 19 crisis in India, oil prices maintained momentum even as OPEC+ has decided to go ahead with previously agreed production hike plans.  Oil prices have been surprisingly steady over the past week, despite serious doubts about the state of the demand recovery in India. Saudi Arabia, in particular, is expected to be cautious when it comes to additional production hikes. The markets have already priced in recovering jet fuel demand  The group is now expected to bring back 350,000 bpd from OPEC+  and 250,000 bpd from Saudi Arabia in May, going up to 2.1 million bpd in July. While the OPEC+ technical committee, or JTC, expressed concerns about rising cases of COVID-19 in India, Japan,  OPEC has not changed its demand forecast for the second half of the year, which is currently standing at 5.95 million bpd. The expected recovery in aviation this summer and high electricity demand in the Middle East which leads to more crude-fired power generation may have supported the group’s decision. With many airlines around the world announcing the resumption of international flights, the markets also seem to have already priced in jet fuel demand recovery in the summer.
 Related Video: Oil on Guard over Yemen as Saudi, Iran Meet in Secret Furthermore, the current uptick in gasoline demand has boosted the US refinery utilisation factor, which is now approaching the five-year average at 85.3% of total capacity. This week, the US crude oil stocks both commercial and strategic had a saw a tiny increase of 100,000 barrels w/w, and current commercial stocks stand at 493.1 million barrels, close to the five-year average. Next to this, there has been a noticeable decline in the demand for all petroleum products by 1.5 million bpd w/w with the exception of gasoline whose demand rose nearly to pre-pandemic levels at 9.1 million bpd, a level not seen since April 2020. Additionally, crude oil production in the United States remains fixed for a second consecutive week at 11 million bpd while the number of oil rigs declined by only 1 rig in the Permian, the first decline in 2021, leaving the total number at 343 rigs. Implementation of the NOPEC bill has never been feasible Another important issue that may be of a concern for OPEC+ is the so-called NOPEC bill, a wildcard that is usually brought up by US lawmakers when crude prices begin to rise. Last week, the Secretary-General of OPEC, Mr. Barkindo, has urged OPEC countries to lobby against the legislation which may put not only their interests but also US interests at risk. It is worth mentioning that the NOPEC bill draft has existed for a long time, yet its implementation has never been feasible. Under President Trump, who was a major critic of OPEC, the NOPEC bill was on the table when prices went above $70 in 2017-2018. Then, when prices collapsed during April 2020 we saw President Trump brokering an OPEC+ deal between Saudi Arabia and Russia, and on top of that giving thanks to OPEC+ for saving the US oil industry.

 Concerns of market share as Iran’s production is rebounding  One issue that may influence the group’s decision this week is the current discussion in Vienna between Iran and western powers which is already showing some progress. This can lead to a scenario where Iranian crude will find its way back to the markets. Its official production could therefore increase by more than 1 million bpd on top of its current 2.3 million bpd. Yet, it is important to realise that Iran's production is already rebounding despite the ongoing US sanctions. Currently, a major part of Iranian exports, 1.2 million bpd, are being sold to China at a discount, in spite of U.S. sanctions. Whether the group will continue to ramp up production until July remains to be seen. Much will depend on the demand situation in India, and it is expected that the group will review its production policy again next month. This means that we may also see a delay in planned production increases as Saudi Arabia may consider keeping its voluntary cuts in place to prevent another price collapse."
European Oil Majors Out Traded US Peers In 2020.html,"Last year might have been a harrowing one for oil markets, but dozens of big-time oil traders netted tons of profit harnessing the volatility opportunities. Exxon wasn't among them.  The American oil giant appears to have failed where its giant European counterparts excelled, according to an eye-opening Reuters report detailing how the supermajor cut funding for its trading unit and relegated it to the sidelines amid a COVID-19 pandemic that others capitalized on, heartily.   While Dutch energy and commodity trading giant Vitol raked in a record $3 billion in profits, Exxon's traders were trying to operate on a shoe-string budget, unable to take advantage of the wild volatility and the high-risk scenario from which European traders profited, Reuters noted, citing nearly a dozen people ""familiar with the matter"".  The Pandemic Trading Scorecard Moving some 8 million barrels of petroleum products a day, Vitol is the largest independent oil trader in the world. But its $3 billion in profits—most earned at the height of the pandemic in Q2 2020—doesn't tell the whole story.  The company also saw a massive drop in revenue last year. More specifically, revenues plunged from $225 billion in 2019 to $140 billion in 2020 thanks to significant reductions in traded oil volumes. It lost nearly 1 million bpd in crude oil trading volume.  But Vitol isn't an oil giant playing at trading. It's a trader expected to earn on plays just like this.  That hasn't stopped European oil majors from jumping in on this game with a drive to win.   Related: Oil Prices Climb As OPEC+ Holds Firm On Output Cuts
 So, how did European oil majors with robust trading arms fare? They made a killing doing what to everyone was rather simple: Buy tons of oil when the prices crash. Store it, and sell when things are good again. Easy enough. If you have the money to spend and aren't trying to avoid piling on more debt.  Royal Dutch Shell said it made $2.6 billion in trading profits in 2020--double what it made in 2019.  Shell's oil trading operations accounted for 43% of its Oil Products division earnings. It is exactly this that allowed it to absorb some of the pain of the pandemic. (Shell's Q1 earnings are scheduled for Thursday.)  BP even managed to top Vitol, indicating to Reuters a $4-billion trading profit for the year.  On Tuesday, BP also reported Q1 2021 profits of $2.6 billion—up from $110 million in Q4 2020—citing record trading (in natural gas) and higher oil prices. Net debt also fell by $5.6 billion, and now share buybacks are back in focus.  The final consensus from inside BP? ""This result was driven by an exceptional gas marketing and trading performance, significantly higher oil prices and higher refining margins."" But BP is a special story that contains the legend of Bob Dudley—the ""Cassandra"" of oil trading who took advantage of the January 2016 crash in crude oil prices to make one of the most stunning trades in industry history. 
 He took a massive risk, which the company signed off on. BP's trading arm made a wager in the neighborhood of hundreds of millions of dollars that oil prices would rebound. They did, and BP made as much as $200 million—though no one knows for sure.   Related: The 5 Most Influential Oil Companies In The World  In last year's volatility, Exxon chose to play it safe instead of propping up the trading arm it had earlier chosen to build to compete with its European rivals.  As Reuters details, for three years, Exxon worked to build up its trading arm, only to abandon it for the most part at the precise time when the risk/reward scenario was the most salacious. The pandemic wrongfooted Exxon to the extent that it became entirely risk-averse, rendering the trading arm more or less unable to make any big bets.  ""Traders were restricted to mostly routine deals intended as a hedge for Exxon's more traditional crude and fuel sales rather than gambles seeking to maximize profit"", Reuters wrote, attributing it to four sources. In 2020, Exxon changed its long-term strategy across the board, moving to focus on its highest-value assets and cutting its yearly spending by some $10 billion.  Right now, we are witnessing a rethink of the oil industry, and Exxon is choosing the path of lower risk. It's still playing out. Debt is a significant issue, and Exxon's 2020 trading options were to risk more debt on a hedge or play it safe.  Earnings are due on Friday, and we'll see how the market reacts to the safe bet at a time when the overall sentiment is that investors are shell-shocked from too much wild shale spending and too much debt. Unless, of course, an oil company stuns you with massive and unexpected trading wins (as did BP and Shell). "
Is Californias Fracking Ban A Big Deal For The Oil Industry.html,"“California needs to move beyond oil,” Governor Gavin Newsom said on Friday when he directed the Department of Conservation’s Geologic Energy Management (CalGEM) Division to initiate regulatory action to end the issuance of new fracking permits by January 2024. That’s headline-catching news, but is it really a big deal for California’s oil industry? The bigger news is that Governor Newsom has also asked the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to evaluate pathways to phase out all oil extraction across the state by no later than 2045. “As we move to swiftly decarbonize our transportation sector and create a healthier future for our children, I’ve made it clear I don’t see a role for fracking in that future and, similarly, believe that California needs to move beyond oil,” Governor Newsom said. The latest action comes less than two weeks after a bill that would have banned hydraulic fracturing in California along with most other ways of extracting crude oil failed to pass the state Senate’s Natural Resources and Water Committee by one vote. The latest action from the Governor, who has said in the past that he himself lacks the authority to ban fracking via an executive order, is yet another sign of California’s goal to lead U.S. efforts in decarbonization and clean energy adoption.   The planned fracking ban itself is not expected to significantly impact oil production in the seventh-largest oil-producing state in the U.S., because hydraulic fracturing accounts for just 2 percent of total oil production in California. It’s more symbolic, really. The possible ending of all oil production by 2045, however, would be a big deal and not just a symbolic move from the U.S. state looking to lead environmental justice in America.  Related: Oil on Guard over Yemen as Saudi, Iran Meet in Secret 
 While environmental advocates cheered Governor Newsom’s action, oil industry associations and trade organizations expressed concern that the end of fracking and phase-out of all oil extraction would result in job losses and increased dependence on foreign oil imports, including from Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Fracking Ban Faces Opposition Just like the fracking bill that failed to pass the State Senate Committee earlier this month, rulemaking to end new fracking permits by 2024 is set to face opposition and likely face legal challenges. “Once again, Governor Newsom has chosen to ignore science, data and facts to govern by bans, mandates and personal fiat. Banning nearly 20% of the energy production in our state will only hurt workers, families and communities in California and turns our energy independence over to foreign suppliers,” Catherine Reheis-Boyd, President & CEO of Western States Petroleum Association, said in a statement, commenting on the proposed fracking ban. “Through all means possible, we will join with workers, community leaders and others who wish to protect access to safe, affordable and reliable energy to fight this harmful and unlawful mandate. We will be a key part of an equitable energy future for California,” Reheis-Boyd added. “That means you also support increasing marine tankers that carry crude oil over sensitive waterways, into already congested ports in L.A., Long Beach, San Francisco — or you must support rail traffic through sensitive areas and communities,” Reheis-Boyd told Los Angeles Times. It’s not only the oil industry associations that oppose moves to end oil drilling in California. Trade unions are also against it, fearing that job losses that may not be replaced with clean energy jobs.  Related: EU Admits It Can’t Go Net-Zero Without Natural Gas “This announcement, steeped in politics rather than facts and science, will bring about the loss of tens of thousands of good, middle-class, blue-collar jobs and double the cost of gasoline and diesel, adding more weight to the backs of already struggling California families,” Robbie Hunter, president of the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California, told the Los Angeles Times. California’s average price of regular gasoline is the highest in the United States—at $3.994 per gallon as of April 26.
 John Spaulding, executive secretary of the Building Trades Council for Kern, Inyo, and Mono counties, told the Los Angeles Times: “I have one question for Gavin Newsom: Are our jobs too dirty for you?” California Is Top U.S. Consumer Of Motor Gasoline And Jet Fuel  While California aims to lead decarbonization efforts and has moved to ban the sales of new passenger vehicles with internal combustion engines from 2035, it is still a major consumer of oil. California is America’s top solar power producer, but it is also the nation’s largest consumer of both jet fuel and motor gasoline. The state accounted for 17 percent of U.S. jet fuel consumption and 11 percent of motor gasoline consumption in 2019, the last “normal” year of fuel demand, EIA data shows. California was also the third-largest U.S. state by refining capacity as of early 2020, while foreign oil suppliers, led by Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Ecuador, and Colombia, provided more than half of the crude oil refined in California in 2019. In total, California is the second-largest consumer of all petroleum products combined, accounting for 10 percent of the U.S. total, as per EIA data. Oil production in the state, however, has dropped by nearly two-thirds since its peak in 1985. Back then, California was producing 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd), while in 2020, the average oil production was 394,000 bpd. California’s oil production is on a permanent decline, the EIA figures show. But legislation to ban fracking and then phase out oil extraction would hit not only California-focused drillers. It would also result in job losses and would further raise the state’s dependence on oil-producing countries that do not plan to heed calls from environmental justice warriors anytime soon.  "
The 5 Most Influential Oil Companies In The World.html,"In a virtual climate summit with 41 world leaders, President Joe Biden on Thursday unveiled an ambitious 10-year Climate Plan that has proposed cutting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% by 2030. That represents a near-doubling of the U.S. commitment of a 26-28% cut under the Obama administration following the Paris Agreement of 2015. Biden, the convener of the summit, intended to use the meeting to coax emerging countries to become more aggressive with their emissions reduction goals. Or maybe he was trying to one-up a key figure at the meeting—China's President Xi Jinping who last year announced that the country had set a goal to become carbon neutral by 2060. Luckily for Biden, Corporate America is already on the hook with his aggressive climate plan, with at least 400 companies led by industry titans such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), General Electric (NYSE:GE), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Edison (NYSE:EIX), Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC), General Electric (NYSE:GE), and PG&E (NYSE:PCG) having signed an open letter backing lowering GHG emissions by least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030. Although the initial proposal will only offer broad strokes rather than a detailed breakdown, Biden's aggressive target has clearly laid down the gauntlet for the oil and gas industry, with fossil fuels being the biggest source of GHG.  Related: Oil on Guard over Yemen as Saudi, Iran Meet in Secret  Oil remains, by far, the most dominant source of energy worldwide, with the EIA estimating that the world consumed 92.2 million barrels per day (b/d) of petroleum and other liquid fuels in 2020, despite a 9% decline due to the pandemic. As the world's biggest polluters such as the U.S. and China become more aggressive with their climate goals, the biggest oil and gas companies that shoulder the biggest responsibility for GHG emissions and are likely to feel the heat the most. Interestingly, the world's 5 biggest oil and gas companies (in terms of revenue) are from China and Europe, with U.S.' giants ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX), and Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) coming in lower at #6, #8, and #9, respectively. China and Asia are likely to extend their oil and gas dominance over their U.S. peers, given that a recent analysis by energy researcher Wood Mackenzie projected that oil demand in the Asia Pacific region could rise by 25% by 2040 compared to 2019's levels. Here's a rundown of the 5 biggest oil and gas companies in the world. #1. China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (NYSE:SNP), also known as Sinopec, is one of China's three state-owned oil companies and the largest oil and gas company in Asia Pacific and the world by revenue after bringing in revenue of $407bn at the end of the 2019-20 fiscal year. It's also the second-largest company listed on U.S. exchanges in terms of revenue, behind only Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
 Sinopec's operations include oil and gas exploration, refining, and marketing, as well as the production and sales of petrochemicals. The company's products include gasoline, diesel, kerosene, jet fuel, synthetic rubbers and resins, and chemical fertilizers. Sinopec's FY 2020 profit fell 42% Y/Y to 5.1B, the lowest since 2015 due to the global pandemic and extensive lockdowns. The company, however, expects the current year to be much better and says it plans to increase capital spending by 24% to $25.55B while raising refinery throughput by 5.5% this year to 250M metric tons, or ~5M bbl/day. Sinopec says China is on goal to become the world's biggest oil refiner by 2025 with a refining capacity of 20M bbl/day, according to Sinopec's Economics & Development Research Institute. #2. PetroChina Co. PetroChina Co. (NYSE:PTR) is the world's second-largest oil and gas company, currently holding assets in 30 countries across the globe. PetroChina--the exchange-listed branch of the Chinese state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation-- specializes in oil and gas operations, oilfield services, petroleum engineering and construction, equipment manufacturing, financial services, and new energy development.  PetroChina has unveiled plans to spend 239B yuan ($37B) in annual capital spending--the highest for any gas and oil company globally--in an effort to increase domestic production over the next five years and also to improve China's energy security. #3. Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (Saudi Aramco) At a market cap of $1.9 trillion, Saudi Arabian Oil Co, or Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222) is the world's most valuable oil and gas company, but only the third-largest in terms of revenue. Aramco is unusual on this list given that it's stock does not trade in the United States.  However, it's a highly influential and major player in the global energy scene considering that it's the leading national oil company (NOC) of the king of OPEC, Saudi Arabia.  Related: The Ugly Truth About Renewable Power Aramco is the largest oil-producing company with a daily production clip of 3.2 million barrels and also owns the world's second-largest proven crude oil reserves of more than 270 billion barrels. Aramco has reached an agreement to sell a 49% stake in its oil pipelines to an international consortium led by Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment and EIG Global Energy Partners for more than $12B. The deal represents another attempt to monetize Saudi Arabia's massive oil assets as the kingdom seeks to diversify its economy.  Saudi Arabia has been making aggressive investments in renewable energy, and has announced plans to forego LNG development in favor of hydrogen. Saudi Aramco remains OPEC's swing producer, and has lowered oil production by 1 million barrels per day in a bid to balance the market. #4. Royal Dutch Shell Plc.
 Netherlands-based, Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (NYSE:RDS.A) operates as an integrated oil, gas and chemicals company.  Shell remains one of Big Oil's least optimistic companies when it comes to the long-term oil and gas outlook.Shell says we might already be past peak oil demand and is bracing itself for a worst-case scenario: Demand to never fully recover. ""I think a crisis like this has the potential to capitalize society into a different way of thinking, much as the Paris Agreement has had,""  company CEO Ben van Beurden has told investors.  Shell has also revealed that it expects ~75% of its proved oil and gas reserves to be exhausted by 2030 and nearly all by 2050. Shell is massively pivoting away from oil and gas production and into green energy, including booking billions of dollars in losses due to huge asset writeoffs. On a brighter note, Shell managed to double its crude and refined products trading profits in 2020 with earnings from the Oil Products division rising to nearly $2.6 billion from $1.3B the previous year. Shell managed to stay in the black despite an 87% plunge in profits thanks to the juicy trading profits #5. BP Plc. BP Plc. (NYSE:BP) engages in the energy business worldwide, including oil and gas production and refinery, trade in natural gas; offers biofuels and operates onshore/ offshore wind power, and solar power generating facilities. Like Shell, BP's trading arm has been doing roaring business during the oil crisis, making nearly $4 billion in 2020 and almost equalling the record trading profit in 2019. The profits were able to provide some support to the company's full-year results, with BP reporting a net loss of $5.7 billion, excluding writedowns. BP has lately become less aggressive with its oil production and exploration, but still remains more active than the likes of Shell. A week ago, the company revealed that it had discovered oil at the Puma West prospect in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico, with preliminary data pointing to good potential for a commercial volume of hydrocarbons. BP operates Puma West with a 50% stake, with Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Talos Energy (NYSE:TALO), each owning a 25% stake."
Suriname Hopes To Become South Americas Newest Oil Exporter.html,"As Guyana prepares to become a major oil production nation the spotlight is firmly on the Guyana-Suriname Basin and the former British colony’s neighbor Suriname. After decades of poor drilling results, ExxonMobil’s slew of large high quality oil discoveries in Guyana’s offshore Stabroek Block has reignited interest in the Guyana-Suriname Basin’s oil potential. Suriname, which shares the basin estimated to hold up to 32.6 billion barrels of oil resources, is desperately seeking to replicate Guyana’s success after the COVID-19 pandemic hit its economy and government finances particularly hard. According to the International Monetary Fund, Suriname’s gross domestic product contracted by a massive 13.5% during 2020, the worst performance in South America after excluding Venezuela.  The fallout from the pandemic is putting considerable pressure on an already cash strapped national government in Paramaribo. There are growing concerns that the deeply impoverished South American nation, which only late last year emerged from a long running political crisis, faces financial ruin. By late-March 2021, Suriname had skidded into default on its sovereign debt. The former Dutch colony’s government in Paramaribo failed to make a 31 March 2021 $50 million payment on $675 million of U.S. dollar denominated bonds due in 2023 and 2026. That caused international ratings agency Fitch to downgrade Suriname’s foreign currency issuer rating from C to RD, or restricted default, which is where according to the agency the issuer of the debt instrument has suffered an uncured default. According to Fitch that is Surname’s third default since the pandemic was declared in March 2020. Paramaribo has been negotiating with creditors for some time to delay payments, and earlier this month secured an agreement with around 90% of 2023 and 2026 bondholders to delay payments until July 30. Even more worrying is that Suriname’s economy despite being tipped to return to growth during 2021 will only expand by a paltry 0.7%, the worst forecast for South America after Venezuela. Those developments underscore Paramaribo’s precarious fiscal situation and why developing Suriname’s considerable oil potential is so important. Related Video: Oil on Guard over Yemen as Saudi, Iran Meet in Secret  In November 2020, the impoverished South American country’s state-controlled oil company and hydrocarbon regulator Staatsolie launched the 2020/21 offshore bid round with bids due by 30 April 2021. The round offered eight underexplored shallow offshore blocks south of deep-water Block 58 where Apache and 50% partner Total, which is now the operator, have made four significant oil discoveries since the start of 2020. Block 58 is situated adjacent to ExxonMobil’s prolific offshore Guyana Stabroek Block and thought to hold up to 6.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources, according to modeling by investment bank Morgan Stanley. Total, which has budgeted $800 million for exploration during 2021, is committed to developing Block 58, targeting up to nine wells this year and anticipates first oil from the block by 2025. 
 Source. Total, Results and Outlook February 2021. Exxon along with 50% partner and operator Malaysian national oil company Petronas, discovered hydrocarbons with the Slonea-1 well in offshore Suriname Block 52. That discovery has yet to be fully evaluated but geological analysis shows that Block 52 sits in the fairway for hydrocarbon generation and further highlights Suriname’s considerable offshore petroleum potential. Toward the end of last month Petronas contracted geo-data specialist Fugro to conduct field work, including a seep survey and geochemical sweep in Block 48, to the north of Block 58, which is aimed at optimizing exploration activities.  Related: Many European Refiners May Not Survive COVID By late 2020 integrated energy supermajor Shell, which has a long history of operating in offshore Brazil, had entered the fray in Suriname agreeing to a farm down deal with oil explorer and producer Kosmos. Shell, for an initial cash payment of $95 million and contingent payments of up to $100 million, acquired a one third interest in Block 42 where Hess and Chevron each hold 33.3% and a 50% stake in Block 45 with Chevron owning the other half. That deal came after Kosmos failed to discover commercial quantities of hydrocarbons with the Pontoenoe-1 and Anapai-1A exploration wells drilled during 2018 in Blocks 42 and 45 respectively. 
 Source: Staatsolie. Note: Kosmos interest in Blocks 42 and 45 is now controlled by Shell. The latest dry hole, Tullow Oil’s much vaunted Goliathberg-Voltzberg North wildcat well drilled in Block 47 which only had minor oil shows, will not derail Suriname’s nascent oil boom. The crude oil discovered to date has been characterized as light with API gravities of 34 to 43 degrees and be relative low sulfur, meaning it is cheaper and easier to refine into high grade fuels. Importantly, in a world where peak oil demand is expected to crush petroleum prices, Suriname has some of the lowest forecast breakeven prices in South America. Analysts estimate the average breakeven price to be around $45 per barrel, which while higher than neighboring Guyana is lower than other jurisdictions in South America. The breakeven price will fall as more oil discoveries are made, the infrastructure required to support Suriname’s burgeoning offshore oil boom is built out and drilling technology as well as expertise improves.    Paramaribo has established a regulatory framework which is favorable for energy companies, enhancing Suriname’s attractiveness as a location for foreign investment. It includes 30-year production sharing agreements, which are longer than in most other jurisdictions in Latin America, giving energy companies greater certainty and continuity of operations. Suriname also established a low royalty rate of 6.5%, which except for Guyana is significantly less than other countries in the region. This makes the former Dutch colony an attractive destination for foreign energy companies. If Suriname can replicate Guyana’s success, government revenues will swell once production begins in 2025 and ramps up from further oil discoveries and offshore assets developed. This could transform the former Dutch colony and take its 600,000 inhabitants out of poverty, if the oil boom is appropriately managed."
